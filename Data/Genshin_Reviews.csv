Review
"A VERY GREEDY GAME, first of all they said they won't make another end game and then 4 years later they did ONLY TO SPLIT THE REWARD FROM 1ST ENDGAME INTO HALF AND ADD ANOTHER HALF TO 2ND ENDGAME, which mean more work for same reward. And when there's aniversary they deduct the primos u can aquired from before patch and post patch, so it used to be 80 pulls perpatch, and they deduct it to 60 and add 100 in anniversary, daiwei cry about genshin change is crocodile tear, NOTHING HAS CHANGE"
I love this game
great game
GIVE ME MUALAIN
Give a free 5 star
First anniversary reward trash. Trash game.
"If Genshin Impact were such a good game why are the players spamming in other games, apparently they don't have anything to do in their game, so therefore Genshin Impact is a bad game then since their players have a lot of time on their hands because they have nothing to do in their game"
Thank you for giving me my xilonen for the last time üòç
"boring since the natlan released, awful character designs, boring story, bland gameplay, gooner game, not as good as before. i hope this game improves and listens to its players. the storyline is only good at first, but when it gets latest it sucks. theres also nothing happening. even tho ur quests are many, its still boring. good thing i moved to honkai star rail"
This game should guarantee us our desired specific 4star characters after few pulls. As for now there is about 16% of getting our desired single 4 star character from the limited character banner and it's 32% if we lost our 50/50. But there is no guarantee of getting the 4 star character that we want. This is so wrong. Stupid money hungry company.
it's not a good game
"bro everything is fan service, all female like only 1 new male 5* star...? genshin what is going on with you? i understand you said there would be less male characters BUT I DIDNT EXPECT TO ONLY THERE BE 1 MALE FIVE STAR CHARACTER????"
nicre 10 10
the game is really good but there's a lot of - because there's tooo many women and fun service game literally need more male characters and I don't like that cause I'm a male characters fun
"i played it before, it sucks. i didnt find the gameplay fun anymore the characters suck too. this is just gooner hell"
Best game
"I like the exploration,characters and sound design but the generousity of wishes are limited as a F2P and is challenging to get a 5 star in an update which just makes it unfair for players who don't spend money on it"
No pity for the player base whatsoever by the devs.
awsome!!!
"I LOVE KAZUHA. EDIT: Ya'll lost a lot of players since Natlan. ALSO WHERE TH ARE THE MALE CHARACTERS!?? we need more hoyo. Y are ya'll putting more effort in the female characters and are completely lazy when it comes to the males. Females play this games too and are even willing to spend, if ya'll want more money and more positive ratings YOU FIRST NEED TO LISTEN TO THE PLAYER'S FEEDBACKS. Do better."
"Beautiful game, fun characters, immersive open world. This game is genuinely fun. Now that controller support has been added, it's much easier to play. My only issue is with how insanely low the drop rates for 5 star characters and weapons is"
"fontaine arc was honestly so peak, and natlan seemed so good at first but its truly lackluster. they've added new features, which is good, but the features honestly barely do much/ are inconvenient. with the new region, the characters dont match the game, the archon quest was good at the start but then got boring/anticlimactic. the natlan powercreep isn't fun because of certain mechanics. music still 10/10. also, be prepared for the devs to give empty promises."
it's a pretty cool game ever . I see in my life üòò
I love this game
"hey hoyo, how about replace English vas cause how many dramas they having rn....plz"
I love how the game is so mysterious and fun love the quality too
Change paimon VA.
"I used to love this game. Hoyo should make more male characters and most of the women in genshin look like children. Natlan is supposed to be based in South America and the Natlan characters' skintone is not that dark. Hoyo should add more rewards to the game (daily intertwined fates, free skin AR rewards? etc.) I saw the newer character (Escoffier's) kit. I am disappointed that her kit and character design is basic. I hope hoyo finally listens to players opinions to improve their game."
"for my queen, raiden ei ü§û"
so good
W rpg game
deleting 1 star reviews won't help you!
already addicted üòÖ
"now the game is perfect with controller support after 4 and a half years. Thank you mihoyoüëç, now its support dual sense, xbox360, gamesir g8 controllers already tested myself."
it was just wonderful!!!!!
I wish you guys adds a controller on android devices.
"So beautiful game, I like this game so muchüí•"
"I LOVE this game, it has lots of stuff even sometimes I feel suffocated by it, but the domains of enemies especially when it's timed is tiring. Even when my character's levels are way higher than the enemies, I somehow can't seem to kill most of the enemies in the time limit... it's an amazing game but sometimes it forces me into a quest like: Palace of the Vision Serpent, I can't leave it and go back to Co-Op, it's super annoying and I can't even play with friends, only talk.."
Love this game!!
Genshin is no longer what it used to be. a shame really.
best gacha game in terms of lore
so pretty much the king
The best game ever!
"The story movement seems static, characters only have repetitive action and the lip sync after many years is still not fixed"
i love genshin impact but the problem is that when I took a 50-day break off it I got back on and my account was gone! but other then that its a lovely game the graphics are out of this world
I LOVEEE THIS GAMEE
I love this game!
It's increasingly obvious that the devs just don't care. At all.
boring lengthy

"Always wanted to play an open world roleplaying game... good thing I found one. great graphics, combat, story... loving it"
make a 32bit ver -_-
"Years of playing and artifact RNG is still a joke. Flat HP, DEF every upgrade. No pity, no progress. Late-game Genshin is pure pain without good artifacts, and good luck getting them. The grind feels endless, with no meaningful rewards. New players, don‚Äôt waste your time. Veterans, stop coping. Rate 1 star. We deserve a better system and actual progression. This game is broken."
I just wanted lumine included even aether is main canon
satisfied
this game is good and interesting story
it's super funnn
best game I've ever played
the verification email getting slow lately... need more than 15mnutes to get it...
best game ever
fun game
i really want to play but i can't don't have enough storage
"I personally play this a lot but ever since some new characters came out it has been getting slightly bad and I've been playing since 1.0 ever since the game came out and it's been well then but I rate at least half because everyone is just mean depends really and I love this game like sm but for right now I think Hoyoverse can do better and make things better as well. But overall, if your new to this game alot of the characters are gorgeous and handsome. The world are absolutely beautiful. Ty"
"I've been playing genshin for more than 4 years. The story, gameplay, graphics, events, characters etc. are all awesome üíØ and the only problem is the community not the game."
All the things are good until I saw the Download MB...‚ò†Ô∏è
"Been playing since 1.3 and this game was literally the best you can play on mobile. The worldbuilding and the characters (that were even a good ratio) were so nicely done you can't help but get attached. Natlan and the new direction though has betrayed our trust and expectations for the game. I don't know what happened with the gacha space but it looks like this game is now catering to the toxicity of the so called 'target audience' Beware innocent new players, this game is not what it once was."
Not listening to players even the ones who spend in the game. New nation character designs not fit at all.
here's a guaranteed 2 star rating matching the guaranteed 2 roll in artifact transmuter QoL 5.5
hooh.
my luck was insane in pulling and life changing game.
"my rating is gone, they delete it..."
"It's a great game I love it. after all this time playing on a PC. I can finally download on my phone. Overall a great game with great story telling. If you only pursue combat action, you can still play it also, but it requires finishing stories to obtain material for upgrading some characters. So be patient and I hope you enjoy the game as I do. üòÉ"
5‚òÜ –ø–æ—Ç–æ–º—É —á—Ç–æ –º–Ω–µ –≤—ã–ø–∞–ª –¥–∏–ª—é–∫
the other game is far better
"only cares about there straight male audience and barely releases male characters, over sexualized women and no diversity, too hard to get pulls and a horrible community this game sucks and could be fixed with such easy things but would rather be racist and over sexualize the women they create"
"appreciationless, but no hates. for all westards, leaving the game is a free option."
"Great game. I love how w3 can explore all the characters. And the main story quest is really good! I liked Fontaine the best. It made me experience a whirlwind of emotions , especially when we could deduce the conclusion. And it was touching as we learned of some characters' fates. The combat is hard to understand for newbies. I only learned because I stay in touch with the fandom. it's challenging for people who don't keep in touch. overall 5/5 they did a lot in this game and it's f2p."
"Just a warning to anybody installing If you don't mind devs not listening and clunky traversal with paywalled QOL then this is the game. If you do mind, play Zzz but with some cynicism or Wuthering Waves with your list of feedback."
"Absolutely amazing game! amazing music, graphics and lore, while the main story(archon quest) can take a hit because they're trying to sell characters, genshin really shines in its side quests(world quests) where they're not bogged down by being a gacha, simply phenomenal storytelling. The lack of male 5* is definitely an issue tho"
"I love the story of this game and it's really fun, just a bit boring sometimes"
"I play on PS5 and I came to make this for one reason only. The way the game handles bugs and errors is HORRIBLE. For the imaginarium theatre it was showing me completed rewards for something I never did, not giving me rewards for what I did do..And when I explain IN DETAIL and provide screenshots they simply give me a copy and pasted ""Blah blah blah, no abnormalities were found."" and dont explain further. They asked for recordings for something that happened 4 days ago, and didn't help me at ALL"
this game is soo cool but the rewards are a bit too low because I did a long quest and I got 40 primos I think we should get 100 or 80 primos but still the characters are so cool!!!!!
"I love it, reminds me of Zelda. But I wish i could have both high frames and resolution. Despite it mzving my phone a mini oven. 4.5/5"
"Oh yeah! This game has a lot of awesome twinks. I love Genshin! (Shout out to Scaramouche. Because ""He was born with a face fairer than any other."" Or Xiao, ""Good looking fella, not too tall."""
"Millions of Dollars income from EACH banners,became Top #1 worldwide mobile games revenue on september (Appstore and playstore) , not including on the other platforms (PC and PS), mobile games of the year. and yet Thanks for the Very very very generous rewards as 1st aniv LoL. Anyway Conrats on your (jokefull) Very First aniversary LoL. For Such a thing has to happened and be A memorable one. Hope you guys learn from that (justkidding, you wont care anyway LOL)"
I'm sorry that I have to edit my reviews on you Genshin but.... I have to do it. I've been playing your game for 5yrs now and I still like the game but not the way it used to be. You see if I will be asked what's the peak for Genshin? That would be the Fontaine update/chapter as that's the most hyped I had with your game so far but after Natlan came.... that's downhill for me right there. So sorry but I have to give you 3/5 ratings.
most wonderful game I ever played
Played for 3 years and it keeps getting worse and worse üëé
great game when it comes to a fantasy game of another world which you can escape to between your real one I would really appreciate it if they can add a gadget that gives a boost to glider when mid air and take us little bit up
"my account got hacked then the hacker changed my email and I filled the form with accurate information to get it back, the devs don't accept it."
"The game started off okay, but with Natlan just seemed to lose everything that made it enjoyable. The story was horribly paced and just didn't fit. The entire region gives off a completely different vibe than the rest of the game, and seems more modern than fantasy. And that's not even starting on the new characters. Just overall horrible decline in quality. Had to quit the game entirely, it was so bad. RIP my account of two years."
increase the event rewards üò¨
sellout
Most fun I've had playing a game in a long time. Hoyo been copping a lot of criticism since Natlan and I don't really get the hate. Natlan has been a lot of fun and the character designs are super cute. Although definitely lacking playable male characters. I mostly play on PC but this game is honestly a LOT of fun. I don't know how it flew under my radar all these years. Worth giving a go for sure.
I love this game
"Ga tau kenapa orang-orang bisa suka dengan ini game. Padahal fitur yang paling bagus dari game ini cuma support gamepad. Itupun setelah 5 tahun game rilis. Sistem pull, pity, 50:50, rusak! Musik ga sebagus dulu. Story ga bisa bikin hype. Side quest bosenin parah. Event reward jelek, tapi harus ditelen. Domain awal sepi untuk co-op. Momon makin o.p, character lama mati aja. Hoyo menjadi game penjualan terbesar di P.S. Namun kualitasnya semakin menurun. Just play monster hunter instead!"
Why cannot connected? Me can't connect :( please help
gim bagus
nice
"wish it had more diversity in terms of characters but otherwise story is great and everything else, except the obvious issues that come with gacha games"
"I like the jiggle physics. Edit: I still like them, and I'm glad they don't use dark skin tones."
fell off
Can't use for more than a minute without the screen going black. Unplayable.
My grandma would do a better job
genshin could never
nais
"this game has been repetitive as heck, you go to a new nation and help archon solve their problems for 2 patches then the rest of the year is a filler patch. same story next year and the year after"
"the game is beautiful, the landscape absolute üòôüëå I personally would recommend playing on a play station or anything that's like that, but if you want to play genshin out and about this is a good choice too one of my favourite games just wished hoyo listened to our requests more but oh well and if you want primos you either have to do loads of quests and explore or paying which you do get around 40 for ¬£84.99 idk what it's in $ but yeah anyways love the game it's amazing"
kinda can cool game awesome graphics and realistic
"The puzzles in Inazuma doesn't make sense and you have to follow walkthroughs on YouTube step by step to complete them. I think my final decision is after seeing Wenut keep coming back to Spiral is that this game truly deserves 1 star. Spiral Abyss keeps getting harder and harder, unless you have a super build team with high end devices, you are not going to be able to do it. Wonderful game ruined by developer greed."
"Genshin is a game I truly love, but it breaks my heart seeing it improve so slowly while other HoYoverse games like HSR and ZZZ get so much praise. I just wish the devs would show that they still care not just about the game, but about the players too. I want nothing but the best for Genshin. Please don‚Äôt let it fall behind."
awesome
The game gets boring quickly. Please add new and stronger enemies.
I have been playing since the second latern rite and i really enjoyed it but i think you guys ruined it for many players with the fan service and that we still don't know much about our sister/brother so i started to playing wuthering waves and it doesn't have so many issues like genshin has maybe you guys should take inspiration from there
even with all the drama now i still really like the game and the 5.5 update was amazing
I like this game so much ‚ô•Ô∏è
"Genshin is great! The quality of characters, New places, Amazing furniture and feature."
"game has a bug, won't even open. just says the game had a bug and can't open. fix it."
I use to play this game alot but recently I've noticed that the game seems to be getting more boring?no offense you guys are trying out new mechanics I get that but seriously I don't think modern day technology was a good idea
very good game Its so much fun to explore
nice
plz make genshin impact in moba 5v5 type version game same characters same animationü´∂üèªü´∂üèªü•∞ü•∞
So good
"One of the best game on the Playstore. The story is intriguing, even though much of the lore feels like cookie crumbles that scatter all over. The soundtrack is top notch. Some of the music reminisces the work of Keichii Okabe. The gameplay is unique since every characters have unique set of moves. The elemental mechanics are fun to experiment since they have a variety of combinations to play around. The world is huge and diverse. If you like exploring a vast world, then this is the game."
"I love this game so much, makes me feel free ‚ô°"
good optimization
good
mantap
best game i played
"In my opinion genshin is such a fun game if youre phone have so much space you can probably have su much fun but if you dont have a too much storage dont risk to download it! It acrually take 33.69Gb, but in other ways is so much fun to play!"
game is soo satisfied
you know what. it has been 5 months since I am playing this game and this is the one of the brilliant game i ever play.the story the graphics the character and (why Mauvika is so hot).Ok this game is like just ü´®ü´®ü§©‚ô•Ô∏è
This is a wonderful game and absolutely best graphics ever seen. The reason I am putting 3 star rating is because this game takes way too long to install and takes too much storage for the people who has no apple phone. All the things apart but the game is nice
game is good but unfortunately my Id got logged out and it's even showing that my I'd doesn't exist when i tried to open my I'd
"Kualitas cerita akan sia¬≤ jika penyampaiannya membosankan. Bahkan, cerita sederhana pun bisa dinikmati jika storytelling-nya menarik. GI dinilai kurang dalam memberikan ""bumbu"" cerita agar pemain tetap tertarik pada penyampaiannya. Contoh dari game sejenis menunjukkan bahwa penggunaan sudut kamera dinamis, ekspresi karakter yang hidup, dan efek tambahan dalam dialog dapat menciptakan nuansa sinematik yang meningkatkan pengalaman bercerita. GI perlu meningkatkan aspek¬≤ ini."
nice graphics
Stop review bombing especially apps and games that have nothing to do with what you are crying about. SUCH AN IMMATURE BEHAVIOR.
having getting good characters and beater areas under my level but other really great game
if you are looking for plenty adventure this is it
"G ada tombol skip g asik,,, tolong mihotod di reply dan di dengar jng honkai mulu yg disayang. Btw thanks for Herrscher of Finalty nya üòÜ"
"This game is absolutely amazing, the graphic, cutscene, character so great, *chef kiss*. But it only one thing that bothered me, it the dialogue too long and unskippable, i hope mihoyo listen to my wish to add skip button. thank you so much. üòç"
to much good and i like adventure

"This game is my favorite game. I played it.. I liked it, but in this game... There is a 30 or 40 GB resource to download... Can you change it, i.e. if you separate it into a low-graphic resource and a high-graphic resource, If you do this, we will save a certain amount of our mobile storage. This is my request."
lovely but no luck.
no luck no fun..
Great game overall a bit racist...
The game is becoming less immersive and latest updates like the chracters does not feel fit in the world of Genshin Impact
"Genshin Impact has amazing music and stunning visuals‚Äîthe world design and atmosphere are truly top-tier. However, the game really falls short when it comes to player rewards. Events and login bonuses feel stingy, especially compared to other gacha games. Older characters also struggle to stay relevant in the current meta, which makes long-time investment feel unrewarding. It‚Äôs a beautiful game, but it needs to treat its players better."
it's a pretty cool game actually
absolute cinema of a game
"4 stars for the story alone, I don't play for meta, the story alone is good enough"
"Fantastic game at launch, became one of the best. Liyue was dull but main story was good. Sumeru and Fontaine were their best. Swimming underwater is amazing. Designs, story, plot twists everything was peak. Then Natlan came and...I stopped playing. A few good designs, some cute monsters but overall designs are garbage they don't fit into natlan, the archon is laughable at best and they need snezhya to save them. Zzz and hsr are vastly better hoyo games. I wish I could skip natlan biggest flop."
I loved it
I have alot experience with Genshin..thank you hoyoverse
"Please add native controller support for Android just like Zenless Zone Zero. Update: Thank you, I can now use my controller for android when playing thid game"
i love this game colour vibrant
"Worst game ever. I forgot my log ins, which is my password and contacted CS yet my application form got rejected TWICE, even tho I can provide proof that I've got the account, I've played on it and can show that I've got the email linked to the account. This is the worst game ever, ig the game doesn't want people playing it."
Great
more content!
Really good game
Best RPG I have ever played. Recommend to all. Definitely worth all the hype about it. Just wish there was character interactions such as when you speak to the girl in the library it should be different speech for each character.
uishh best siakk
this game is for weebs
"gamenya sangat seru gameplay yang tidak terlalu sulit, graphic yang bagus, story yang menarik, namun, drop rate gacha nya terlalu rendah, sulit untuk mendapat senjata atau karakter bintang 5, yang dimana saya merasa bosan ketika menggunakan karakter yang itu itu saja, berharap dapat karakter b5 namun sangat sulit, mohon maaf saya uninstall."
"so.. I love this game, I played this because my friend asked me to play this. But I'm kinda bad at playing this tbh I always asked my brother to help me, and he always help me too. overall yeah it's not kinda bad, I enjoy playing it."
STILL NO SKIP BUTTON
Made this game better please
good
the game is best üòÑüëåüèª
great game so many place to explore i recently is interested in ororon but since i dont have water i cant used him plzz make the nightshade blessing active with all elements not just water
"I've been playing for a few years now, and my experience has gone downhill. I really do not enjoy the new stories. The new characters don't feel like Genshin anymore and make me feel nothing, unfortunately. I have migrated to Honkai Star Rail, where I feel like the story lines and characters are more cohesive."
I keep getting kicked out the app
"garbage game play, story and character atk"
that a really impressive game. and it‚Äôs performance much more greater that wuthering waves.
somethings could be better like running while charging bow based characters element but all in all not bad. haven't gotten to the co-operative play yet will edit this when I do
"It's an awesome game, but on mid-spec Android devices this game somehow looks and runs worse than Monster Hunter on the PSP. Unstable framerates on 30fps, unplayable on native resolution, murky low resolution effects, and unneeded visual effects on potato settings, namely dynamic grass blades and terrain surface specular mapping. Maybe the game is simply unoptimized. The game looked and ran better on an iPhone 6."
I love everything about it
I slowly watched this game go from being fun and enjoyable to what the heck is happening and boring... tbh I don't think I'll play again until they reach khanria.
"everytime I try to log on even tho I put the password and my email and my device is connected to everything, the game still requires a security verification, however, your process doesn't work, your systeme isn't sending the security paswword.. I've played this before it's a good game but this ruins it. happened to me on several devices os I know I'm not the only one with that struggle and I know how small of a problem this is.. fix it, there is no reason it should be in this state for the lengh"
lacking a lot. very dry updates. i miss fontaine this months imagnaiiurm theatre or whatever is called way too difficult and made me mad
love it
amazing gameplay
Uninstalled due to anniversary rewards and events. No half resin event? X2/3/5 artifact enhancement chance up? Reduced x10 pull discount? They even had no weapon banner pitty until a certain youtuber spent 2k dollars before getting it. And the resin system is so bad. And another game got the artifact load out before their 1st anniversary. And this game with a 5 year headstart ignored majority of player QoL feedbacks. Nah I'm staying away from all Hoyo games.
"I love the graphics and music, etc. But when it comes to my storage, it takes a lot, but I love this game, so I will give it all my storage."
I lost my progress i wass level 35 plus but after deleting my id was back but my id was in past time at only ar 17 i want my progress back
"I've played since the beginning. It's a great game, neat characters, great story, and pretty fun gameplay. The only problem with it is how little rewards it gives you. But other than that, it's a solid game."
"Love itüóø and I don't careüóø, I just wanna play with my friends üóø"
"Natlan character's skin tones are brighter than my future. Hoyo, if you're going to take inspiration from a heavily colored culture, do so *accurately* and don't just make all the skin tones like a brownish grey or whatever you guys did on the chibi character. I refuse to spend money in this game anymore until there is proper representation from the places you take inspiration from."
Good game with so much potential.. But controlled by the worst Devs and Company ever..!!
please Add Area of Elvesüíï Oak Trees Because Similar like Throne of Elves or Dragon Nest warrior down or Add dragon too if u want! but please Add Area like Oak forest Place and There Live elves tooü•∫üíï
"I had to download 1041 GBs of file's and I did and it crashed so I couldn't play the game and by the way I spent almost 5 million tomans on this game and I don't recommend the game and this is the exact worst game I've EVER played in my life and I'm gonna sue if this happens one more time, what now huh okay I've gotten my reports and everything and now see you in court"
one of the best game in my life
"it's so horrible, a literal gooner game"
I love it üòçüòçüíìüíì 5 stars
the storage is not giving
garbage
worst experience game ever no logic game
"it used to be fun and interesting but it's too damn repetitive now, boring dialogue that you can't skip. The characters aren't diverse and the they're obviously targeting people with oversexualized women characters too....not enough men characters either..."
so efikel
good
lots of fun beautiful world cool characters interesting combat system just sad it takes up half of my phone's storage space
Best expirience
i love it soooooooooo much i can't say in words must try it :)
Best game ever it's like watching s anime but being in it
Can't skip yapping
"Genshin Impact is a masterpiece. With its beautiful world, fun combat, and engaging story, it‚Äôs one of the best free-to-play games available. Whether you like exploring, fighting, or collecting characters, there‚Äôs something for everyone. If you haven‚Äôt tried it yet, you‚Äôre missing out! Rating: ‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê‚≠ê"
nice nice
very good game
SUCKS
Release more male characters pls
"The game is actually great, but it's a bit hard for beginners since we have to keep up with the ongoing content. The story is progressing well, but we‚Äôre missing out on a lot of events and rewards. I hope beginners can receive better rewards to help them catch up and progress more smoothly. Overall, the story and characters are amazing‚Äîthey really feel alive."
some of the puzzles is wasting my time without any hints üôÑ and should have skip story too.
baguslah ini game
the quality is so goodü•∞ü•∞
Bad Account Verification. Too hard for login any devices
This is one of the best games I've played on mobile.
i love it so much it's a wonderful game. i play it in PS 5 and it's so fun. tough i have many account just for restart the game that i have played the story. my friends wanted to play this game to because i played it and tell about the game that super duper fun. this is my top 3 favorite game afterall. good luck Hoyo i wish the update gonna be more way fun then i expected

Please replace them like tighnari's old english va, isn't it called harassment what there doing to Kinich's new va?"

"This is becoming very predatory by increasingly locking even quality-of-life features behind purchases and pushing kids that still play this game towards spending. I will not miss this game. P.s. NO! I will not email this obvious point to your ""customer service."" Honkai Star Rail is also walking down the same path. Hoyo are aware of their predatory practices, and I have no hope for any fundamental changes."
pretty good
cool
Terimakasih game baik!
is really awesome to play
Wow It's gooder than other games sooooo crazy
can't be opened even though the device should be able to
What a good game!!!
"it was playable before Wuthering waves released. exploration is frustrating, rewards aren't so good, the story and some of the voice acting is goofy and irrelevant. if you just wanna waste time go ahead. this game only cares about your money"
"Pioneer? sure, but not much has changed since it was released. Overused character animation, lacks of QoL and even if there is, it is locked behind paywall and of course unlimited yapping for eternity with no skip button"
"Makasih min, berkat adanya game ini, saya menemukan kesenangan yang sebenarnya. Gak peduli jumlah primogem yang dikasih tiap eventnya berapa, yang penting saya main game ini hanya untuk bersenang-senang. intinya, memainkan game itu tujuannya untuk menikmati permainannya, bukan malah menghujat. Kalau dikit-dikit protes karena primogem yang diberi sedikit di setiap event sambil membandingkan game sebelah, mending gausah main sekalian. main game lain aja sana, cari yang banyak giftnya tiap event."
till AR 60
I love this game so so so soooooo much hahaha (:
developer sama pemerintah gak ada bedanya üòπüòπüòπüòπ
starting was confusing but very good game
this game is my favourite game ever
"did a quest, reached where, didn't work. fix this."
no skip button
"I like this game, but I'm boring about the build characters"
like genshin impact
Natlan felt a lil bit empty same goes for char design n game play specially splash art like dude why is mauvikas bike is everywhere but i give it five after whats waiting for us in nod krai so excited i hopefully no fan severs n a lot of girls
"great game, giant open world, a lot of freedom, amazing graphics, beautiful character design and fun fighting mechanism. the main story line is decent, the gameplay itself is very fun. while archon quests have memorable events happening, it got some boring quests too which is frustrating. world quests are really fun especially Natlan world quests. however, this game isn't for me, as when you progress further in game it becomes very repetitive with charcter ascension and stuff."
"best fantasy adventure, rpg games, everything's beautiful, the music and characters are so perfect, and the new nation, Natlan is the peak experience, best music, best scenery, best area, best gameplay, best environment, best mechanics, best characters. i love this game ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•"
"Poor QoL, and unvoiced characters"
Awesome Fantasy World!‚ù§Ô∏è
"If it was not for Genshin Impact, I would still be single :D"
really nice game but use a high end device
good
Finally got Jean after 807 days at 5/15/23 (my account was made 9/29/2020)
good
Change the English VA Paimon and I will change my rating.
"A 4 year old game with little to no-effort in QoL updates, while their other games get better QoL updates. This game became a laughing stock when it comes to improvements, right now. REALLY? SEARCH MAIL FUNCTION? WHO ASKED THAT?"
Good
Give us a skip dialogue button and i will change my rating to 5. Not everyone playing this game likes to hear constant yapping. You need to adjust to your target audience and not the other way around. While other games like Wuwa have no problem implementing this.
"this game is very fun, full of exciting story lines."
"I would have gotten to give this 0 out of 5....You know why because of these bunch of lunatics so called Hoyoverse devs ,making this game worse and worse eventually.And above all, it sucks that they never actually listen and care for their community.All they care is your money pocket.Lastly it's been 4 years already passed and yet they just keep trying to convince to make manipulate people.If you wanna start play, I'd suggest ,you better not spend as it is not beginners friendly...."
it's very nice game
"Game is almost 5 years old, sheer lack of QoL, lots of new content but without improving user experience. Devs don't really listen to player feedback and keep implementing features that very few would likely use. Lifeless story dialogues, lacking facial expressions and proper lip syncing. Anyone defending that Genshin is a great game should try other newer games like Infinity Nikki, Wuthering Waves or Girls Frontline 2."
"The game always add equally beautiful scenery and vista for each release especially for recent Natlan release. Unfortunately performance issue isn't as optimized as before after recent update. 5.5 hasn't improved much aside of the new map. there's some miss from start of 5.x version, mostly minor but it add to disappoinment by 5.5. However, the ambience and overall enjoyment of the game is decently consistent."
"add enable gamepad lama"" jadi jarang main di hp game"" sebelah aja uda enable gamepad rating saya turunin ke 1 dari rating 5"

"After buying a high end phone, i now enjoy playing this game. Developers are really dedicated in making excellent adventure games like this. I love it."
"i wanted to play your game but it says ""too many request"" why i cannot login? those things makes me so UPSET. DONT MAKES THE LOGIN EXPIRED WHEN US DOESNT LOGIN IN A LONG TIME. PLEASE BE WISE. thank you, HOYOVERSE."
"Vast Map, Impressive battle features and strategic combos. A good RPG game on Mobile."
i hate hoyo
so good
Good game
Good game for some journey to defeat monster and boss or thing
(edit) I've played this game for over 3 years now and it's not a bad game but the devs are just very greedy and make this game predatory. I used to love this game but I'd say wuthering waves is just leagues better
"so bad genshin, i played since 2020 and now my account was lost. i tried to login with email address and the server said ""too many request please refresh page....."""
giving ratings that houo deserves in their games
Still no skip button
best game ever
Fun to play with an exciting very puzzling Adventure Mode.
You are diggging your own grave hoyo Please stop this powercreep nonsense. Other than Fontaine and Natlan character's most of them are being criticized. Everyone liked Genshin bc of their reaction mechanisms but now you are launching a character with high dmg scaling WTH IS WRONG WITH THE DEVELOPER I DON'T UNDERSTAND üòûüòûüòû I'M REALLY disappointed üòî
beautiful!! lovep
Best game ever
to much space in inventory
"I used to love this game , but now it is lame and boring. All the money spent on this game was the biggest mistake. hoyo got greedy, and we paid the price. update 2025 is getting worse I regret the amount of hours and money the i put to this game is not resources to be able to pull for a character if you loose you 50/50 the happens to often to make you spend money to have that character I have enough bay genshin I hope you get what you deserve for this kind of practice you are not the gatcha gam"
it was the most amazing game and I loved playing Natlan the story line and the game play was serious amazing
‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
so I'm gonna go to the point I have two android 14's and one of them can download genshin impact this one can't and the other one is broken so I can't use it can you make it available for more devices!!!!!
"I'm only gonna give it 4 star because the traveler need a voice actor like bruh, every cut scene in the game, have all the characters a voice actor except for the traveler, plsss the traveler needs a voice actor in English btw thats all. ohh and About the game, it's absolute Peak btw. good job on making all the special effects ratings 10/10 and all the characters. üëçüëç tombs upp"
good story line and game is fire
"my enthusiasm for uncovering lore and experiencing character development got me through most of it, yet my glass only fills with a salt like substance leaving me more parched than ever. (I loved the adventure though)"
best game
nice game
the game experience is great the characters are the graphics are great the map is big
"everytime i re-downloading this game is always stuck at white screen afte hoyoverse logo, and its just on my phone. like does my phone just get restricted for playing genhsin? or maybe software issue? if i resetting my phone, the game can be played. but my personal data could be erased. its wasting my inernet data since im using operator card. i want to playing this game again but, yet.. still cant be opened.."
best game ever played.
please fix the imaginarium theatre by putting the retry button on the last stage It's a waste of several hours! then we have to see unfilled stars due to the recklessness of the devs who put no options for retry button!!!
I lovee this game! the character design and graphics. The story is also so good esspecially the new update. They always listen to the community and keeps us busy with lots of events. I cant believe this game is free!!
"I love this game. It's definitely worth playing on PC or console. My only main issue is that it is not controller compatible, which makes it much more difficult to play, I'll have to uninstall it cause it's not worth playing mobile version due to this."

Love the exploration aspects of this game and elemental combat. edit: i want the SKIP BUTTON im late playing Natlan now its a nightmare to finish.
niceÂ•Ω
"I am having fun with playing this game! The exploration can be a bit challenging if you don't know what you are doing. Liyue and Dragonspine exploration is especially something I'll remember as the one that gave me a challenging time. Chenyu Vale is an exception because I find the area relaxing and climbing isn't as difficult as main Liyue area. The game is generous enough, can't see why the some players kept saying ""Genshin couldn't"" because of the events both in game and in the hoyolab."
"I was really enjoy this game before, It can be 5* but the quality of the character design is going down especially dont like natlan characters (is not skin color problem but overall the characters doesnt look like they belong to genshin) and this game barely giving any primogems reward, genshin not listening to their player, if it going like this I may delete the game soon"
One of the best open games with a great story plot!
"I'm OBSESSED. I've been playing for about 2 years, and I've NEVER stopped playing. The character designs, exploration, events, quest, everything is just so.. MWAHüíã"
"Re reviewing the game after playing for more than 3 years now and i must say. Despite being a free to play game, the story, world, and overall enjoyment is very similar to those paid console games. No one came close to the amount of content this game provides specially for a casual player like me. That is also made specifically for mobile. One thing's for sure is that this game is definitely worth to play today and i might make a new account to experience again that adventure for the past 3 year"
gooner game
"This game was fantastic, but it has since fallen on its face. the story has died and stays idle for far to long. the new characters are cheesy and boring."
cool graphics
played since day 1. dislike the new region and getting tired on the story. hopefully there's skip button someday. dislike daily while keep reading same dialogue everyday. if only dev listened üò¥
cant login to my new device. late ver code -_-
no skip button
I can't find anything doesn't work
Best mobile game ever
It's so beautiful
this game is incredible you can do many things and how the game looks is even cooler and I recommend playing it and there are many characters in this game to and you can glide in this game to and I love this game very much and have a great day :)
it's good in everything like graphics story line etc but it takes a hole day to loding

"9 months ago, i dropped this game. Now, I thought of coming back to it again, and spent some money. And then only to learn that this game became much worse after recent update. Now i regret coming back to this game."
"Pretty awesome characters and storylines with superb visuals. Great events and solid Storyline. World exploration is the best thing with a solid immersive music. EDIT: 5 years into game, the game so far only this year has only 1 patch so far for world exploration, no male limited characters exist anymore."

"I initially started playing in 2020 but didn't get very far before quitting. I began playing again in 2022 and immediately fell in love with it. I've had tons of fun playing, I love the world and the lore and I found Wanderer who has become one of my all time favorite characters. I mean all this to say I'm not happy with the direction Hoyo has taken the game in as of late. Although I still like the game, although I still play I have played less overall since Natlan was released."
"artifact rng is so evil, you won't be able to finish your desired build while new character keep coming along with their new artifact set, but as long as you don't spend money, this game is playable."

A great game to play. It guides you.

"This game was amazing when I started, but ever since Natlan, I've lost all interest. QoL features behind paywalls that are necessary to explore Natlan without wanting to rip your hair out is just downright predatory and that's enough for me to say goodbye to this game. It was a great 3 yrs, but these predatory actions are not what I want in a game I play."

Replace Paimons English Voice Actor
"Terribly balanced characters, ""endgame"" content is just a dps check with no real challenge, 80% of the events are copy pasted reruns or old event mechanics with new graphics. One of the harshest gacha systems out of the popular gacha games, and a company that refuses to listen to players. They would rather move onto the next game and then drip feed you content and qol changes rather than continue supporting the game. Edit: Now completely overshadowed by WuWa gameplay wise."
nah
l love this game is a bit hard but its overall great
Deaf developers annul every positive point in this game. Natlan so bad.
3 years of lantern rite and still same worth of penny rewards? What a joke of a company. Learn from HSR Edit: Looks like it's HSR that learns from you and doubling it down. At least Genshit knows how to make Global passive.
this is just such a gem great action and story the graphics are great too hoyo brings great updates
not good üòê
"all the characters look so good, and the main characters also looks cute, and the graphics are also good, well my only problem is the loading resources screen because I even needed to stay all night to download it, but it was all worth it because this game is so calming, I always play this every night whenever I stay up! >:DD"

"Genshin Impact is an exceptional game featuring remarkable designs and rewarding events. I highly recommend it for fans of RPGs, open-world exploration, and combat games with rich lore."
I LOVE IT it is my favourite game too.

I really like the game but I've been trying to get into the game more than 4 times now and it just doesn't let me in. Can anyone help me?

Best game to play ever. But gets repetitive and boring to play. Also low end devices aren't very optimized to play.
The previous text I didn't write. But the game is GOAT for me I like the game very much I play the game like 3-4 a day hour. But after my brother's PC died by an error I can't play anymore :(
I gave a 5 no reason I'm just bored
"genshin was my first ever game that I ACTUALLY loved playing. the lore is amazing, the story, the quests, the themes, its all so good. monsdadt and the earlier nations are so nostalgic omg the lore is so good especially the celestia lore. the game itself actually got me emotional like 40 times. but recently genshin has been going kinda downhill ... the characters are okay, but the standards were way higher before. the story and overall just natlan was kinda boring. hoping snezhnaya is insane"
I don't know...leave me alone
"This game is so cool the graphics, story, character, sound, weapon and map. But please make a ""SKIP BUTTON"" Edit: please make this game easy, it's hard to get perfect artifacts, i'm wasting my resin for trash artifacts"

Maybe I'll come back when the mascot va is changed because I don't wish to hear paimon when her va calls us idiots on main
"i love wriothesley so much, without him, this game is idk, 3 stars???????"
the va's suck replace them!
someone hacked my account and i rate it one star because you didnt give my account back
amazing game
"Still the same wall of text simulator, while QoL is still slow or no progress. Even mangas with drastically smaller budgets have better and more engaging text to read. Genshin just wants to artificially stall and force their writes to make the longest unskippable filibusters and in the worst format and delivery."
When fighting childe...he becomes too overpowered overwhelming the character even when u reach the required level to fight him..... Could u guys level the playing field to make it even so we can proceedüòÖüòÖ
"the game starts be worse , more sexualized characters , no good plots and collaborations with bad companies like MCDONALD'S"
best game of the year is this game
Not bad
"4 tahun main ga pernah menang rate off, mantap"
i did one play through then made a second account for another the story gets more exciting each time
"Genshin adalah game yang sangat baik dalam segi story, powercreep, dan qol nya sudah jauh lebih baik dari dulu. tapi kebanyakan karakter yang dirilis hanya perempuan, jadi saya pun yang player cowok merasa sulit untuk mendapatkan kesempatan menabung if. belum lagi deadweek di genshin sangat membosankan. 1 minggu terakhir tidak ada aktifitas yang bisa dilakukan kecuali daily dan weekly boss, setidaknya berilah kami sesuatu yang lebih seperti x2 artifact/material seperti di game hsr. itu saja."
the greatest game ever
bad microtransaction. convoluted story. low character quality
I just wanna stay until the last chapter
gameplay is great but story is falling behind a little
"it's fun. yeah power creep is a bit bad but doesn't feel as terrible as in hsr. as for people having problem with fan service and others liking it, grow up it's a game. you're not looking for a girlfriend, you're pulling a character, it's job is to be fun and pretty"
"I love the design,lore,characters,animals and the nation ü§çüñ§"
"natlan was so bad, they didn't even try."
Game kikir pelit amat kami udah muak dengan bersyukur
it's best i never play story lines but this took my heart
This game really blew my mind with its action-adventure style in a fantasy world the only downside is the storage u need its great imo
good
I like this game Because having a good time and perfect graphics makes me stunned :3
"I've been a f2p for years now, and I haven't won a single 50/50 in all of my time playing this game. Dude, do you want me to spend real money on a free game just so i could enjoy it?"
"The company of this game doesn't listen to their players, ignoring them and adding useless new qualities in the game instead of fixing the problems in the game. THIS GAME DOESNT CARE for its players. DO NOT PLAY."
hoyoverse in tcg there over powered characters like kachina and mona and rosaria and cards and there characters and cards that should get banned or nerfed so the tcg in genshin impact and i see that if characters their hp become the double like 10 become 20 and 12 become 24 that will make the game more funnier in the end hoyoverse please don't leave tcg like that you must balance the cards and characters
Good Game must try if you can
game kikir
really really really trash game
It's so fun I can not wait for the next update
best
"main dri taun 2022 sampe sekarang belom bisa move on klo di hapus, selalu aja pengen download lgi, cuma ya memori HP kurang mendukung, sbenernya isu nya cuman itu doang sih... sejauh ini belum bisa nemu game yg bisa menggeser game satu inih"
"The game I think, is going down a spiral of death. Natlan as a whole just disappoints me. I mean even it's world quest IS BETTER THAN THE FREAKING ARCHON QUEST. Aren't Natlan supposed to be a fiery warzone?? Nah, just a bunch of friendship shenanigans. And PLEASE just remove the condensed resin thing and just make the base resin needed to claim into 40. Those crystalflies oh man really grindy and frustrating to farm."
compiling shaders EVERY TIME I log in
Gem kikirrrr
the game is really fun and the customer support does a great job.
great game .
"clearly superbb but ü•≤ there is one problem ""PRIMOGEMS"" And ""STORY QUESTS"" why cant we skip this story quests like whyy we cant skip its story part and grinding primos feels like we're doing labour its so frustrating üò≠"
good
"Overall quality of the game tanked in the last year. The characters look awful and are poorly written, the story is leagues worse than last year's, the new region itself makes no sense, all the new mechanics don't function outside of the new areas, and no matter what the reasons are that Genshin hasn't signed with the union, the characters have been silent for ages. I'm starting to think they made so much money that quality isn't a necessity anymore. They only seem interested in sex appeal now."
"The game and story are great. The gacha, however, really pushes you to your limit. with that said, i have collected a nice amount of characters (took me years) and i am progressing just fine with the game, barring from some very end game content. So, if you just play this casually then you would be in for a good time. hardcore plays though would need more ""support"", if you know what i mean."
please oh please just make a black character. why is almost every character pale üíîüíî
baduy mag bigay ng character wala sa banner. from last year august banner until today walang akong nakuhang bagong charater or kahit luma. you just empty my wallet. never gain playing your game.
edit. I love the game. the complaints are understandable but mass spamming because there isn't enough dudes is insane. plus there's a whole new dude getting added soon. they're making good qql changes and are making certain things more worth doing.
"you can explore the world which is so much fun and u can play with your friends too! you can fight a boss and there's also archon quest. It's a story about teyvat which is the world we're playing. I love genshin because you can gacha,explore etc. I love the lore so much too! the backstory. people might complain how many storage genshin take.. but it is worth it you know? the quality is sooooo good! it's realistic."
loving the game so far ü´°
Scam Loot Boxes
Good but not comming until Anemo Archon gets a revamp.
"I personally love this game and spend my free time playing this. The gameplay, animation, characters, stories, and quests are all really fun to do!!! The animation is so detailed, and the quests are insanely fun!! Events are so fun as well!! Everything is wonderfully well written-I definitely reccomend."
so good üëçüòäüòä
nice
Uuuuh...this game is kinda mid to because they adding too leveling stuff and hoyoverse making weird characters fix ts
I love this game!
"One star for outstanding anniversary gift 10 pull , lmao there is no way I am gonna swipe my card for u going for f2p for rest of the life with u .ü§ëü§ëü§ëü§ëü§ë update -this game now a disappointing and with natlan war of nation is now war of ration you need food to fight I mean ig the developer are more like amateur who like to be puppy which will make this baby game with games inside."
"the graphics were good, the story was interesting, the music is intense, the characters are impressive, everything looks fine"
game ni memang best tapi setelah saya main selama 3 minggu akhirnya crash
"I just love ‚ù§Ô∏è this game... it's so much fun to play. The game is really balanced, like the combat and world exploration is easy to get into but at the same time, it has depth, the elemntal combinations like fire and ice, water and lightning and much more to experiment and enjoy, the characters are all distinct and memorable....the open world is cool and fun to explore with lots of things to do.... all together, I'm having a very enjoyable and fun time with it on my Samsung A35 (runs smooth AF)"
"Can someone help me? My acc start from the beginning of the game play, this happen twice to me, after I login using my Google acc it's start from the beginning I don't know why, my first acc 2-3 years and my second acc Half year and now you want me to start it again? I lost my two acc and I don't want to play it again! I'm so disappointed I contact the team but no response! üò≠ anyway I got my account back thank you team, I really appreciate! now I gve you 5 star for returning my account!"
Its a Fantastic game ever I played! üëè
good game but please [Recast English Va that don't do their jobs :)
"The time to build a character takes forever especially when it comes to artifacts, the RNG is so bad. Used 4 sanctifying elixirs and it rolled to one desired roll and skipped the other one completely. The feeling isn't really rewarding as we only get an elixir every 40 days and some from events, and the others from exploration, but the moment it rolls to bad rolls? What's the plan? You just sit there and wonder what's the point in even farming anymore. I've been playing for 5 years straight btw."
"can't change my email due to ""too many log in request"" always"
it so goood
fix global passive in star rail
"very nice game and chill , have 0 adds in it , other games devlopers should learn somthing from this game."
"this side , some of it fill with A.I . take some minute and then look the review. same reviews with a twist to look different with each other. don't know why fake reviews here."
An advantureous game of travelers!
love it
"One of the best games ever. Almost everything is immersive. Enjoyed travelling, the environment and music together felt breathtaking, soothing and peaceful. The quests, dialogues and characters are all interesting so grinding was not boring."
worst than worst. game is really enjoying but after every update it take 1-2 hours to download even after fast wifi network. every time download download and download. shaders download file download and again and again download download download. even you cannot minimize or background download.
First it was release it was a magical adventure and immersion for people stuck in global lockdown. Been playing it for years... Now it's just a slacker of a FOMO kind of cash grab through endless sob stories and lengthy dialogs. Putting effort doesn't feel so rewarding and there so many things that needs improvement yet developers doesn't hear the playerbase voices/feedback.
PLEASE HOYO CHANGE SOME OF THE ENGLISH VOICE ACTOR!!! After what happened And of course everyone knows what happened. besides why did we expect??? and how much after what happened the NATLAN EXPECTATION!!!! in fact i play this game for like quarantine days I'm really happy and I am enjoy to play more But the Big PROBLEM IS 50/50 IS NOT EVEN 50/50 MORE LIKE 90/90 Not GOOD And the worst part IS TOO MUCH DIALOG THERE'S NO SKIP BUTTON THE PRIMOGEM IS ONLY 30 OR 40 AFTER THE LONG WAITING
"this game is literally so beautiful, it has such mesmerizing scenary, alot of quests, alot of characters you'll probably get emotionally attached to, the lore is so in-depth, yet its no interesting that it makes you wonder what will happen in the future, nice ost, especially for Fontaine. it has such a romantic-esque and elegant style. this game is 10/10."
"been playing since release ocassionaly, fun and interactive storyline and combat, there are some issues but so does any game"
when are u guys goin to add SKIP BUTTON? the amount of dialog I have to watch and tap through is unbearable! Pls add SKIP BUTTON ASAP!
it' very beautiful game and it' story was really good I like this game
love it
Game tolol
"LOVE IT SM, but add more boys char please üò≠üôè"
I Love it
Cool
tbh idc about the fan service I just love the story and game overall and the designs of the characters and if you think the characters design is lewd then you guys are the perverts here I just wish they would increase the resin up to 240 that's all love this game playing it for 2 years!
"it's a really good game, lots of things to do and diverse methods to achieve them, however quests are 90% just talking and is really hard to get a good artifact still."
"the game has taken a very unfortunate turn to fanservice. theres CHILDREN playing this game. your main audience is teens/older kids, and MOST of us dont want to see people getting sat on. please hoyoverse, you guys were absolutely COOKING with fontaine, please go back."
"I just hate it, the fandom, the events, it became a boring game, nothing was interesting in the game plus taking alot of storagw is too much"
"this game is decent, but when it comes to customer service it becomes bad. my account was hacked for about 5 months and i keep sending the account retrieval form. even if i provided the most obvious evidence that the account is mine, they still refuse to believe it. i hope i can talk to an actual human for the customer service. rather than computer that just keep rejecting my form"
"i love this game so much, i suggest to make the game more fun and and make it easy for low quality phone users"
I love it üòçüòçüòç
this is a very good game but for Android it is nearly not playble as it demand 32 gb as an in game downlode
"I used to love playing this game. But, I just don't know what got into them. I've deleted all of my hoyoverse accounts and never touch this again."
"It's done I've played this game since 2021. Still there's no improvement. Not just the story even gameplay, characters and quests have sunken in quality now. Fix your damn servers. I have a stable 100mbps connection yet I rarely get ping lower than 100!"
"thanks for Varesa! I started playing because of her and this game is pretty interesting. anyways thanks again for the cute cow girl, great design and fun the play."
"I really don't understand the game's creators. Many people wrote that they were unhappy about the lack of a skip button, but nothing was done, and if they did, it was only to respond to comments and apologize. I have wanted to create another account many times, but when I think about having to listen to all the dialogues I heard once, I regret it. ""Add a skip button"""
"I absolutely Love this game, the characters are fantastic, the story is amazing, and the graphics are Gorgeous especially Fontaines! Honestly we Need: Android Controller Compatibility at this point, Better artifact RNG, and a Higher resin cap. Please raise the resin cap like you did in HSR/ZZZ or raise the cap on how many condensed you can have at a time we know it's possible, sincerely ppl who have to work."
two many goddamn updates kinda ticks me off about this game.
game is good but the powercrept is a big issue
"After update 5.0 wow the game looks beautiful especially for the environment in natlan, for the gameplay mechanic in natlan so fun doing exploration, and the best part is the story and its music great as always"
The current issue with the EN VAs and how they're harassing people and spreading lies are hurting the image of the game.
perfect game
it's such a lovely role playing game and I love it so much quality so good and like overall this game has such good potential quality and I love the characters too and the way they designed everything is so lovely
these game is great all adventure is endless
why there's a bug??? won't let me in the game and say the developer should fix it and get an update!
crazy how I never even win a single 5 star draw rigged lmao
ok
it's cool. but I don't really know what to do with my tons of mora
Superb
"Disappointed, I'm just disappointed with this game ... they're losing players who have been there for years , god it hurts to see how the game has turned badly..."
ur game is buggy as of late rip frames pls refrain from incrementing new regions and fix some features
"Natlan - the nation of fanservice. Is this what they meant with ""Going back to the roots?"" Yikes."
"I've been playing for a year and half. I like the anime style of this game. Graphics and performance are excellent. This game is well optimized compared to other titles with the same ""tag."" It all comes down to luck and money. But as an F2P, the best thing is, at least, you can play the game without paying for anything. In some other games for whatever new came out, you have to pay to get that. Here, you get things depending on your luck. Even without luck, there is some degree of gerunteed."
"Wonderful Game. so much effort and thought put in to produce such a beautiful, vivid, and charming experience. I am thoroughly enjoying the journey so far. Well done, and thank you."
"AMAZING. Amazing stories and fun quests, ive been playing since version 1.4 it is an amazing experiance, id wish to experiance this as a new player again if i could."
"I used to enjoy this game a lot but ever since 5.0 came out Genshin just doesn't feel the same, the story execution was bad and events are starting to get boring. The designs are looking awful all of a sudden and I honestly don't know where they're going with them, they feel so out of place and makes me feel like hoyo isn't even trying to make something good. They're bad at listening to the player base if it's not the CN community. My motivation to play completely disappeared"
"The game was very fun, I played it since the first day it came out, I enjoyed the gameplay, character design and story, but since Natlan came the concept of the game changed completely, even the character designs became focused on Fan service and nothing more, there are no male characters and the game focuses more on females, it became so bad that I retired from it"
Whole game is just made by AI and tries very hard to make people spend as much money as they can. 0/10
bawiin ko tong 5 stars kung walang 5 stars na character.
Wasting Time
super explore experience
I really love this game
"I've started playing this game last year May 2024. While the gameplay was nice especially quests and open world adventure. But sometimes it's just kinda bored since it is open world adventure and gotta wandering around for hours just to look for quests. And also, the update and installation of this game takes very long to get in. Please make this game a bit more fun and more quests make me less bored and also shorten the duration of update. It's just take too long, hopefully fix that that's all"
size is so so soooooo biggggg
Very good game in my life
Garbage factory of potential
Great game >_<
"I never actually got to play it cause I'm impatient the loading takes a long time I mean you can't even exit the game cause you'll just start over again, all I'm trying to say is pls minus the loading time"
"Game is great.The story,ost and characters is amazing.One thing that could be improved is endgame content.As it stands there are only 2 endgame content,abyss and IT.Can we pls get more content and pls make it coop.Game gets stale when there's coop but there's no incentive to play it..."
ok
disappointing direction this game has taken itself over the years :(
"Finally has official controller support on Android after all these years! One of the most beautiful, vibrant worlds I've ever explored. Filled with treasure and puzzles and more side quests than you can shake Paimon at. With so much to see and do it's easy to get overwhelmed but it's an incredibly enjoyable world in bite-sized pieces. The roster of characters continues to grow making it more likely you'll find a character whose playstyle you enjoy!"
fun
THE GRAFIC IS SO GOOD IT'S THE BEST GAME I EVER PLAY
"at first it was great but now, the contents is getting boring and not fun to play."
really good graphics and adventures
Hyv kung nag reply ka ibig sabihin niyan buhay pa ang aking asawang nag ngangalang Thrainüôèü•∞üòúüòª
this game take so long to open that it just driving me crazy üò°üòí
it's great I guess
good
Really love to play
"To be honest, I enjoyed the game at first, but there are a number of issues I have with it. Poor storytelling, most characters feel rather one-note personality-wise, minimal rewards, awful gacha, game mechanics are very poorly explained, overreliance on text for almost everything, missing character voices, some areas being laggy AF, overheating issues, minimal QoL changes since day 1, and the awfully toxic and braindead community. The Inazuma Archon Quests were so bad it made me drop the game."
my favorite game ‚ú®üéÄ
best game ever.
"prtty good mechanics, i love the elemental things"
garbage
good graphics
the storyline and storytelling is amazing I would recommend to any person who loves MMOs but the downside to the game is the gambling part of it where you spin for characters. other than that the game is gas
good game
Really genshined my impact
"I actually love the game and the creativity and the open world aspect of it but it's sad to see how the voice actors treat another voice actor to taking a role and he didn't know about an american issue when he was in japan and it's disappointing paimon's voice actor, and other voice actors treat him with disdain please replace these Voice actors as they dont have the professionalism needed to work on this app."
Lost track of Story. Predatory Gacha. No Content. EN VAs NEED TO BE FIRED. ENOUGH SAID. Play Wuthering Waves Instead.
"It's one of the best games I've ever seen, but The ping in our country is so poor that it's so hard to progress in it and I Think that if their voice chat in it it would be a lot better."
"de lo mejor para android, hermoso en todos los sentidos ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞"
the game is very cool even the storyline but we need offline mode bec the game work online and that is not fair for low network people
great game.. i wish they release more male characters and give players more rewarda
Gooner game
heh... A childish joke against Wuthering Waves. but... not bad for Teenagers
In the beginning it was all fun. now it just trash. Not worth spending money in this game anymore. No improvement.
this game made my life and I was shock because the graphics are so good.
i used to love this game but creating a monster killable by just natlan characters? that's messed up in the theater you don't have a lot of choice for characters and they dropped a boss from natlan messed up mihoyo
5 stars for me I don't care about others.
Still the best RPG I've ever played.
"tried logging back in after a while, only to be met with a 30 minutes loading screen for shaders. tried to reset my password, but all they codes didn't work, and the emails were also nearly 10 minutes after I submitted the request. I am not impressed"
"the game up until natlan is amazing except some of the characters been muted for so long. just change the VA, hoyo. the ENG dub players want the same experience with JP/CN/KR dub players too."
bring back their voices
"I'm like relatively a new player, currently playing on another account. Content is rlly fun, and there's a lot of characters you find yourself really being attached too. (my personal faves are furina and kaveh :D). I guess what got this a four stars is it's lack of community support? I'm not sure exactly how to say it. And if you've seen Natlan, that explains it too. overall, I hope when we get introduced to new places + characters, they'll listen to their fanbase more, and just improve? <3"
i love this adventure game its so fun ‚ò∫Ô∏è
it's pretty good. The Lore is on point and the girls are cute ngl
Great game!
"yapping, give skip button right now"
"SHADERS FOR MIDSPEC UNNECESSARY. Please give us option to disable it. My phone is draining much battery because of it even though the phone state is good and repaired. THE REASON WHY I tell this is I play in very low graphics, SHADERS are useless for this case. MY POTATO PC RUNS BETTER SINCE the game runs without needing it (iGPU). REALME9i. Last played a month ago. Not like this. PLEASE OPTIMIZE. TYSM."
"bro this game is Soo good but it's not free to play, I need to pay for me to play, that's absurd bro you guys made this game playable on mobile devices but why do wee need to pay for us to play ,this game is so good but the payment bro where not Rich."
absolutely garbage. revenues wasted.
"Game was once great, but the company just drops new characters without adding new areas. Natlan has been the worst region by far. Mihoyo does not listen to the fan base at all. No quality of life work at all. Company is also just leaving characters completely invoiced in quests that are main characters because they don't want to pay the voice actors. Game has just went to trash."
"Genshin impact takes inspiration from countries and cultures from around the world and shows it with the sceneries, character design, and more. However, they somehow cannot create chars with a dark skintone properly. When they actually make chars with a dark complexion they make those chars grey or make them a trash dmg dealer. If they are taking inspiration from cultures, why cant they show those ppl from the culture they are taking from? Because hoyoverse is a racist game."
"I love this game. I don't like that the devs treat the playerbase like donkeys, dangling carrots in front of us on sticks by leading us on with bad rewards. Please make a change and give us the rewards we deserve. UPDATE: it keeps getting worse. whitewashed Natlan characters, soulsucking events, dead patches, and just... lack of direction. don't play this game."
This game is the best game in the world
graphics like anima but... story game.... is so goood
I like it. It plays like Zelda Breath of the wild.
"It's a really great game with amazing graphics and some cool quests and stories. ofc there are downsides to this ""amazing"" game. With the game being so hungry for money, it's almost impossible for f2p ( free to play ) players to get limited items and characters, which will make the game harder to play for most players. After Natlan's release, this game has become a waifu game with only having 2 male characters in Natlan. The game is basically getting worse by the update."
"REPLACE ALL PROBLEMATIC EN VA LIKE PAIMON VA, KEQING VA, CANDACE VA, SUCROSE VA & ANYONE ELSE WHO'S BECOME SAG/ASTRA BOOTHLICKER!!"
Really best game
"I used to love the game, but I slowly relised the predatory practices they had were getting worse. Also, Natlan just flopped for me. The scenery was beautiful, but the story got too long and boring. The characters they put out were cool, but i didn't feel like they fit. if they actually started listening to players, I'd join back, but for now I am not coming back."
"This games it's so beautiful and fun to play but the problem it's that about how much gb it is. A low phone can't handle this game but they really want to play it I wish one day they make a phone that can handle 1k gb for better save storage for future updates well there still more map upcoming and maybe in the end we just cry cause we can't handle the gb anymore, but still wish there's some phone have 1k gb haha"
"Nice open world with raimbow and roses that hooks me in the long run. Even in the end game keeps playing without burning out on repetitive daily commission. There's no waste or even left out in combat aspects, 4* star character is not being singe purposes that you can find enjoying experimenting on their potential with time investment. minus 1 star for having outdated QoL."
"love the game, amazing story line and graphics"
The game was awesome but me personally dont like the story after inazuma its doesn't feel right we need MC character development
"I've been playing Genshin Impact for over two years now, and I‚Äôve never felt bored. Hoyo always brings something new with every update whether it‚Äôs fresh lore, new characters, or an expanded map to explore. It keeps the game feeling alive and exciting. Of course, it‚Äôs not perfect. The gacha system can be frustrating, especially when you really want a character but luck isn‚Äôt on your side. Still, there‚Äôs something about the game and the sheer beauty of it all that makes it worth playing."
How to put less than one star?
good
"I have a mountain of complaints. But it's nothing that no one else has said before, so I'll just say what everyone else has been wanting. Add a damn skip button! Ffs, Wuthering Waves has it! It literally will not kill your business to put in a skip option! And while I'm on the topic of Wuthering Waves. While they're just as guilty as providing fan service like Genshin, at least they give better rewards! Unlike this game, that is stingy and greedy af."
good story and animation
good game
"Genshin Impact is Best ‚ú® But, It take space More So, I say the game owner to solve the problem solving the problem we can play it."
"I love this game. I've been playing for over a year now, and it's my favorite gacha game, i love exploring, and that's what originally made me start playing. the scenery, not to mention all the cool characters you can get! my only problem is that hoyo needs to listen to players' problems a bit more. and INCLUDE MORE MALE CHARACTERS PLSSS."
"So much fun but very addicting lol! Updates frequently with new and old characters, absolute adventure fantasy fantasia as long as you keep track of the time you play!"
"Nice game playing it for almost 6days enjoying it, but i would suggest to make it more free to play friendly."
absolutely perfect game
"very predatory game, keep your kids away"
remove castorice's global passive!!!
predatory game don't play this everything is paywalled
"It was fun for a while, and then one day, I logged in, and all my characters and all my progress were gone. I haven't played since I've re-downloaded and re logged in multiple times over the last year or so, and it's still gone I had razor bennett that maid with the huge sword and the nurse character with a few others. if I can't main razor anymore, there's really no point in continuing it was fun while it lasted. Maybe one day, I'll figure out how to fix it and re do this review."
This game is so bad it never listens to its players and it never will
its Best Rpg Game Im Ev Play‚ù£Ô∏è
soo good game ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èü•∞ü•∞
obviously it is the best game out there . But I would like to thank Ambani more then developers which msfd me able to play this game . it is whooping 35gb after all üòÖüòÇ
good game
"not bad really, I've been playing for a few year now, The only bad experience I've come to is Just my device isn't really supporting and it gets laggy sometimes"
devs won't listen at all
it was a fun game before but now I deleted it because it's not fun anymore yall don't take any effort on this game anymore it's boring and sexualize
"Unfortunately it's impossible to install due to game file size for people who have weaker devices couldn't you guys create a demo offline version with just the Liyue and Fountaine arcs, it would be w nice way to celebrate the game's success and maybe preserve it. Never mind you can play the game through cloud streaming on Nvidia geo force now."
i like this game
Great üëç
nalla eruku but romba kiru kirunu eruku
Aaaaaaaaaaaa take my life
"At its current state, it's no longer at the top of the game. Outdated QoL, uninteresting storytelling (a far cry from Patch 4.0 Archon Quests), recent character designs that just look so out of place (and time) in its world. Until they turn things around in Snezhnaya, they're in a slippery slope falling off."
best game I have played on mobile thank you HOYOVERSE for designing this game üòçüéÄ
after more than 5 years no great QoL update and some QoL behind paywal
It's a good game but it takes a lot of space It needs a lite version for the low end device
Good game
"This is an exceptional open-world game, providing a highly enjoyable player experience.This open-world game offers a captivating experience. The vast landscapes are truly immersive and beautifully rendered. Exploring the world is a constant source of wonder and excitement. Many adventures await those who dare to venture into the unknown. It sounds like a fantastic journey to embark on.üòÑüòä"
Best game could ever be everything is perfect
to much female characters
This game is so good
It's 100000% fun.And the graphics omg deadly first time I am playing a game of storylines and its awesome!!!!!
game's rlly fun just dont be part of the fandom. they are RLLY problematic
IT TOOK UP ALL MY STORAGE üíîüíî
natlan was a BIG downfall. stop making useless characs 5 stars PLEASEEE
"great game, people may say it sucks but you meet great storylines and alot more!"
great game
pls add more cryo dps
Why does my genshin 5.4 update is 13 GB?
"The story has greatly fallen off, the cultures that inspired Natlan are nowhere to be seen, and the characters are the most cookie cutter, friendship is magic cast I have encountered in my nearly 5 years of playing. The new mechanic ""Nightsoul"" gatekeeps you from clearing endgame and events unless you have ridiculous investment or own at least 2 of the new cast. Hoyo has gone from releasing interesting characters to cow women who fight with their backside and making a waifu simulator."
this game is very fun but my luck is very bad
not good my account is hack and i appeal and always ai email replied .. its been a year and no freaking good when it comes on waiting for account recovery. very nice mihoyo
I truly like this game
love thisgame
Very epic game
this game has been always kind to me so what can i give more? the experience in the story really touched my heart i don't know why people always trashtalk/badmouth this game but whatever my opinion means nothing to others anyway
I'm addicted to it
it's fun. highly recommended to those who likes open world rpg
Love it ig.
"its been great time to play this game for the past 2 years. the 'multi-billion' company yet still gives worst solution for every feedbacks the players sent. if u can't bring the player want, why even make a survey with promising update feature for the game?? u know u can do better but u don't do that. this could be my last patch, and thank you untill this time."
"Hi, Is it just me or did the game take a lot of time to load it is taking forever pls let me know"
game in good . but new update are trash and lack of diversity .
Wuthering waves is better :3
"Wow , keep releasing more female characters I'm sure the gooners will definitely like it ü•∞üòÅ"
worth to download
great game BUT THE VERIFICATION CODE TAKES TOO LONG TO SEND EVERYTINE I LOGIN FROM ANOTHER DEVICE
cool
ok
Gud
prety good now in helio g99
"As a player that have been playing this game for 4 years more or less, I quiet dissapointed for some aspects. 1. There is no skip button. 2. Now too much fan services. 3. Forces players to pull character since natlan is released, the more you have natlan characters, the easier you can explore. 4. Unlocking traveller's pyro constellation is really waste of time. 5. Bad RNG system, everything's RNG :D But since the devs didn't care what can you expect?"
it is very good game and it's grafics is so awesome üòé and adventure also so try this game but it's resources is 26 GB ohh my god but nice game please try this
"I looooooooooove it TwT , I'm addicted!"
paimon so annoying. quality is dropping
"why is the code email so take so long to finally show up? mine shows up 4 minutes after the countdown/timeout! it's so annoying and my Gmail doesn't even take up pics in it which means I have more than enough storage for the codes to send faster. fix this, please"
Game started off good. I've been playing since early 2021 and the game's lack of men character is reaching region by region. Not Kinich being the only 5* ever. ü´•
"man, compiling shades takes ages to be updated üò≠"
Short answer: everything is god tier from graphic gameplay to lore but the pity system from artifact to character banner are rigged
"Hi hoyo! I have been playing since 1.6 in Eng Dub. Recently, I haven't picked up the game, because of the weird drama. Most of us know what has been going on with the whole VA thing. Recast Paimon's annoying af Eng voice, you will save entire playthroughs. We Eng Dub players have been having this complaint since her voice became more of a highpitched screech in 2.0. Please."
well is very good don't know what to say ‚ù§Ô∏è
We need more PRIMOGEMS and that's a fact
"I just wanna say one thing ""THIS GAME IS FREAKING AWESOME"" you can guess how good is this game and if you are thinking that size is just too big then i say that that size is worth it i say it again that the size is worth playing this game (edit) i changed smartphone so it runs even better tho after newest update due to more area and things it does drop frames but as long as I use mid setting it's all 50fps which is good for me"
good and nice üî•üî•
ruined experience due to some eng VAs
"i really love genshin, but it has started to get boring lately doing the same stuff again and again.. daily resin etc etc is so boring ik there are events and stuff but we need more end game content, its just not me but I've seen my friends and other players complain about it too.. i hope there will be new things added in future.."
This game did not change at all throughout its lifetime.
this game was so fun and open world
I LOVE THE WAY THAT 7DS ORGINS LOOKS LIKE THIS THAT JUST SHOWS HOW INSPIRING YOU GUYS ARE
good game but lacks in diversity and doesn't have much culture for non Asians inspired regions other than that the game is really fun and helps pass the time
good‚ô•Ô∏è
English VA's are terrible people. that plus feeling that all my old characters are useless compared to the new ones has finally made me quit after being a day 1 player.
Trash game since 2020. I regret playing it as the devs no longer give importance to their players
The game is great though it has some issues. It has some server issue.Lack of optimisation and yeah paimon not letting me explore the area. Btw my processor is snapdragon 7s gen 3. please fix these issues.
"Game went full waifu bait. Used to be a game with a good diverse cast. Gameplay is boring, barely any rewarding combat. Enjoy finding >6,000 chests (not an overestimation)"
Its a very cool game but it has some bugs and it couldnt be played in some mid end mobiles too
"an overall great experience, but I'm having trouble logging in on my phone. whenever I try to log in, it flips my menu and I can't log in. not sure how to fix this, I've tried reinstalling it and everything."
"Aside from the interesting lore. this game has never improved so much from this recent year. Imaginarium theatre is so hard bro. Not to mention they've never listened to the player's voice about how to make the game better(dark theme, artifact preset, etc) that's why so much OG player has left the game."
it's really good üëç
like it
wow that's awesome to play something yeah 5 stars the game is cool !!!
Not happy with the new sanctifying elixir update.
"it's like a copy of Zelda, not bad"
once u give us the changes we want u get a 5s rating
I've been playing for 4 years and still love this game
add a skip button.
it's really fun.
pls fix this my acc for 2 year l can't open even l log in on your website sill it's said try again later when I try to log in again later it's still say the same thing plsss plsss fixxx this
its ok for now
"Everything is fine, but sometimes the sound of pimon's speech hurts earü§ïü§ï"
nice game
"very fun, i love the game art design,but i hate the end game content because it's very repetative."
i love this game ü´∞üèª
"this game is SUPER amazing, it has cool graphics characters and alot of other lore stuff that can make me question whether this game is a fairytale or just fanservice. anyways, your game is 'okay'"
I want to play it but the loading screen is very slow in samsung
This game consumes too much storage and both ways if you download the cloud version it not even better cause you have to play to play. (They really messed up)
GIVE ME ((PRIMOGEMS)) HOYOVERSE T_T
no comment just 5.
"Superb Exploration, Great Lore, & Unique Character Designs"
Will not change until they roll out cross-server function to consoles.
there are not much event and primogem to farm
"I hope the game devs update/fix their interactive map, like if they show all the treasure etc that marked so it's not so hard to find, my complaint is that they show all the location of the chest but if i go to the location there's no item, so it's kinda confusing"
Is game
bad
should reduce fan service a lot
Every week I think to quit I delete game but I can't quit this masterpiece it's my love
"Not really free to play friendly unless you really grind which is tough for people that don't have the time . Nice characters and story but the rewards are really lacking ,if you just a casual player who doesn't have the funds to buy your character."
p2w game
"Idk. downloading this game feels annoying on PC. Well, I don't have anywhere else to comment about Genshin on PC, so I will commented on here. Why are there so many downloading, patching, and verifying steps? I'm tired of it all. it's super annoying. You can't make them into one process? godh"
"hey, genshin aint so bad compared to hsr :D"
The Devs are so worst and useless in making the game better. The game is not worth Playing anymore. Time consuming and boring.
"This is the best video game I've ever played. The story keeps getting better and better, and I really feel like the developers are doing a good job with it. The rewards are perfect, especially recently, so it's entirely possible to get any character you want without spending much money. By the way, I've been seeing a bunch of reviews on here about wanting an option to skip the dialogue, and I hope they never add one. This game is about the story, so if you don't like it, maybe stop playing."
really good game if you like exploration and simple combat but it has some problems it's gotten way greedier recently releasing to very wanted characters together and on addition to that they locked most of the main rewards after the banner ended and they've only been improving currently because they have competition
It has really fun
worst gacha experience as I always reach soft or hard pity while pulling for characters and weapon compare to my friends who get early or double 5 stars
Taking too much time to start the actual game other wise it's great
amazing story
it's a very interesting and cool game
"Genshin Impact is a fantastic experience! Malaki talaga yung na-occupy na storage space sa phone, pero ang ganda ng graphics at immersive world. I love how you can explore different regions, each with unique quests and treasures. The characters are diverse, and the elemental combat makes battles exciting. Even with the storage issues, the adventure is totally worth it!"
banner system is kind of bad
unexpected ü´£ü´£
extremely Stingy game. hates it's own fan base and never gives them rewards. you better off Downloading WuWa because they at least give better rewards.
great game. +3 star:üî• -1star:unlucky/resin +1 star:coz of fountaine
love it definitely recommend
after 5.5 update I opened Genshin but it didn't work and it showed that the game closed because this app has a bug it also showed thar try updating this app after its developer provides a fix for this error
This game gives me peace of mind
"on rails story experience, your hand is held all the way through by a character called paimon, who repeats every detail thrice incase you didnt get it the first time. there are qols every patch, but not the ones you'd want, even though they exist in the company's own offerings."
I'd love to have my first pull a five star character
It was a wonderful experience..
game is fun and there is lots to do. it does take awhile to collect good characters but worth it. I would play in any language other than English though because they ruin the game and haven't voiced more than half of the stuff. plus paimons voice is very annoying
useless game
"just woww the quality, the experience all are amazing and we are getting it for free just hoyo try giving more gifts otherwise just perfect"
"WORST GAMEüò°Very hard to find complete World quest there is no logs System available For World quests like the Archon, story, quests logs. üò° Most of the times we can't find the required quests to access locked areas and sometimes to unlock other features of game like the Chosen of Dragons Avatar is really confusing and hard to get even after completing all the quests many players did not get the last quest which is required to unlock the Avatar. üò°"
"""Mind-Blowing Adventure! Genshin Impact is a masterclass in game design! Stunning visuals, captivating story, and addictive gameplay make it a must-play. Pros: - Immersive open-world exploration - Engaging combat mechanics - Memorable characters and storylines - Regular updates with new content Cons: - Steep learning curve for beginners - Some lag issues on lower-end devices Despite minor flaws, Genshin Impact is an unforgettable experience."
"Hoyo thank you, I've been interested in this game before it's officialy released in play store, love the style, design, music and it's aesthetic also the plot make me want to adventure in this game as traveler and hope to reach it's end,I excitedly recommed this to my friend and also make new friend from this game, but since sumeru I feel the game become longger than it supposed, still I fall in love again when fountain release, but in Natlan but sorry I feel Genshin lost it touch."
"Hi, i have an error. my phone is a Samsung a12, why is there no Grass, Text damage, Water from distance will bright up it's will make my eyes hurt, and lag. please, even though it is compatible.. I am using the Snapdragon chipset. Do I have to replace device? Hope to read it."
ginseng is very my favorite game
Osmanthus Wine taste is not the same as I remember
it's been great
No controller supported and bad graphics view
God game of RPG
"YOO BEST ADVENTURE GAME, i really like the arts and also the character <3"
I love the game! Very good graphics! I love the story.
"The game is nice overall. But, its extremely time consuming and grindy. There seems to be too much dialogues and useless errands to complete a quest. Also, the artifact and wishing system is very annoying. If the wishing system was similar to Honkai Impact 3rd, it would have been a much better experience. Nonetheless, the story is really captivating, the world is majestic, and the characters are well-designed."
bad storytelling telling no life in characters
ye real hota to acha hota
"New regions, exploration and quest quality have improved, and the open world experience was always great. However, I don't understand what's happening with this only hoyoverse game that stopped releasing 5 star male characters at all. Every update there are more and more unnecessarily sexualised and childish female characters, while the player's gender ratio is 45% fem and 55% male. More than 10 of my friends left the game for the alternatives, Natlan was unbearable."
"HP cpt panas, tapi game nya mantab"
add skip button and reduce fan service?
"I am editing my oft review because of the disappointment I have over the natlan patches. power creep has exploded overnight, the characters no longer fit in the world, and the gender ratio is going down fast. day 1 player and very sad. old review: Beautiful graphics and amazing story. XD Albedo is awesome and my favorite by far. Mihoyo also takes good care of it's community, giving plenty of opportunities to be f2p while also having access to every part of the game."
do better with your qol updates. mikir dek
Very wonderful game but the dialogue of the story is too much in every mission.
"dah setelah 5.3 gua putusin untuk uninstall, 4,5 tahun main gak ada perubahan, yang berarti di game ini, buat player baru gua gak recomended maen game ini, kecuali kamu maw dengerin yapping seminggu lebih tanpa bisa di skip dan explorasi yang super lambat dan menyebalkan,Qol yg apa adanya, cukup orang2 yang masuk kejurang dan tak bisa naik lagi saja yang main game ini, jangan menjatuhkan dirimu ke jurang penderitaan"
I just wanted to say I wanted to play this game like forever but 35gig god damm have some mercyüòÖ
we need more male characters üôÉ
"terimakasih sudah menciptakan xiao, mihoyo"
"Characters designs and stories are well made, but the main overall plot is non-existent. Adventurer rank 40+ begins the miserable abyss and artifact gearing grind which ruins the game. EXPENSIVE GACHA. TERRIBLE RATES. DO NOT CHASE GACHA. Caution and do not spend any money on this game to enjoy it. 3 years no community appreciation. Devs never fix any problems. EX: no android controller support. Hoyo choosing to burn all their goodwill with toxic game systems and gacha."
Love it<3
"love this game, just give more primos üòÖ"
I like this game
the new pity system was a lie and I lost my 3 months saving
"Wherever you are,no matter what life throws at you ;In Teyvat,the stars in the sky will always have a place for you"
Please fire all SAGAFTRA VAs or just those that bullied Jacob. If not that I think people will be happy if you recast Corine.
amazing!
ü§¢
nice story
nice game
this game is very nice thanks to Dhar man I washed his vid and I saw this game and it is fun
"I can't do the quest 'the tree who stands alone' pls fix it, this is my favourite game I've played so pls fix it. and another thing is on some of the quests some people talk some people doesn't have a voice so i hope the game can make the all the people in the quests can have a voice . well another bug, when u are doing Jean's story quest when babara says 'why is that' the word down there says 'Hmm'.the icon of the whopper flower near the Luhua pool is wrong there's two and they are fire whooper"
This game improved a lot now. Really impressed with every QoL update they offered. Keep it up Hoyo don't ruin it !!
"Trash Game, most hate mechanic is lately everything is require Nightsoul !!"
cool
This game takes a lot of space but it's worth it and only thing that I wish they can add is horse to ride on cause it takes time to get to your destination especially if it's far
I want more pixels on my screen btw the game is peak
very amazing experience
"well,this is game is amazing! it does kinda lag in my phone but it's no problem... unlike the storage but it's okay! üëç me,my brother,and my sister love this game. nice graphics and character design! although it's getting kinda boring... heh,guess I'll have to wait for snezhnaya and La Signora :) (...) (I CANNOT move on from Signora's death and I'm still upset even though she deserves it üò≠)"
the best gacha game ever with the best lore the only complain i have is to please let us new players play past limited time events
üëç
I'm not sugercoating or anything but this is the best and my favourite game of all time sure it has some flaws because every game does nothing's perfect but the best part is that they learn from their mistakes and omg the lore of this game it's the BEST lore in a game I've ever seen and I hate the complain impact (the toxic and always complaining genshin community) but the game is very very good I'd say anyone reading this should definitely give it a try and if you don't like it then delete it
I LOVE RAIDEN SHOGUN.

it's a fun game
good game
this game pmo icl like ngl it crashes like sybau?? fr pmo bru..
very nice
"Game is very good but I had to get cloud gaming service to even try this game, My phone is not Mid-Range or High-End so it gets me too much problem like I can play only 30-35MINS a Day"
it's a great game
Die
"this game so good, i like this game so much"
no good rewards
"This game used to be my most favorite game ever, where it accompanied me throughout covid and I used to play it everyday, making new friends and having fun. But ever since natlan, the amount of fanservice has been very concerning, it doesn't feel like the game I used to love. I played genshin for the fantastic story, cool characters, game mechanics. Now I know games can change and update, but it doesn't feel like the same game. I don't hope it changes like the old genshin, but rather get better."
"i'm sorry, but before I change my review rating you NEED to replace the problematic VAs. REPLACE CORINA BOETTGER"
it's a really good game and the graphics are so cool and the characters skill are super good
Love the game but plz you can honestly do better
"Extremely greedy developers, never listening to fan base"
"this game is very fun, but the fandom is toxic"
good for lonely peoples
Such a well put together game that even the gotcha junk doesn't take away from the experience too much. Well worth the massive download time! Ha!
best graphics and. story game in play store
Over all great game love the gameplay of the characters but only if it wasn't laggy on phones and more smoother like I have great wifi but I stil lag
still no voice on english dub. replace them who still under strikes
kikir lu
"A lot has changed throughout the years, the game reputation back then being great. Being one of the best-selling games. Now it's hardly any of that. Everything changed. Since Inazuma, fan service has been shown even more. During the time Inzuma was released (2021), the game was 10+.. Just let that sink in. It's an okay game, I guess, just not as fun as before."
I played this game for months and I don't playing because my phone is low hand device that why he lag in 25 FPS But This Game Is Good That Why I give full star. I will Play Again When I will Buy a new phone I'm poor so I have to 5 years to get new phone huh suck life
not enough rewards
it's slow to load but i like it
so bad
Just the best game for me ofc. The teason why i like Genshin so much is because it was the first video game i downloaded and after playing for a while it became my favorite video game.Can't stop playing Genshin.The storylines are so cool and awsome
Y'all chillax if you can't play the game yet. Tomorrow's the actual server opening.
great.fine but the storage file should be reduced.but fine cinema
Nice Game Top 1 OpenWorld Anime Game On Mobile!!!
"the game play, story and characters are beautifully made and are very interesting"
Make pulling more cheaper
I love this game
I love this game ‚ô° and Those who don't want to do voice actin in the game should be kicked out
ew en voice actor
Just... No.
"it's a cool game, but everything is pay yo win! i can't keep up with it anymore it sucks the fun out pf the game."
"I loved this game so much when i started playing, the story is engaging and i still find it very amazing and free, but latley the combat style is just decreasing and Va's get replaced without contact or even that they could do anything about it. It's dissapointing. A game with so much potential and all that the people care about is ""Whale"" numbers and being dramatic kittens. The developers only listen to one community and never to us, very sad. I still love this game tho."
literally did a slow download and wouldn't let me play until the download was done so i never got to play it takes too long for it to download contents
FULL OF BIG HOT MEN. EPIC WINNNNNN.
I was doing the new quest about rasie the phologist stone barrier and it messed up now it won't fix what should I do
"pls fix this, your login system sends otp too long to the point that the app says you've been in this oage for too log, pls fix that, tnx"
just give skip button..
the game is good but the problem is to login is very bad cause I need to wait 4 days just to login that is so bad
Amazing game
the Devs won't listen to it's player base very sad not gonna lie
Love the inazuma and natlan gameplay
not worth your time
"revised my thoughts!! powercreep makes me sad, and the story is really weak sometimes!!! I find myself really bored and frustrated with the game how it is, and I wish they would innovate more. I would not recommend getting into this, you're honestly going to have more fun watching reviews of the story and game rather than playing it üòûüòûüòû"
"Nice and captivating game, except you are forced to watch almost non-ending cutscenes. If I want to watch a movie, I watch a movie and not hours and hours of characters who have a headache... Usually I go and do other stuff like my lawndry or other stuff waiting for the cutscene to finish. The problem: you are forced in-between to select game unrelevant dialogue. Lately the cutscenes just kept on and on without stopping. After 4 hours, I pressed [Alt]+[F4]=forced shutdown. I deleted the game."
I love this game but it takes so long to load üò´ I like still am loading aaaaaasaaa
Amazing game and amazing story
I love this game
honestly
I left it to download for 3 days its still downloading even tho my network works fine
i forgot bout my previous review but shaders will not compile. literally unplayable
it's very beautiful game. if you like Anime go ahead and try this game..and at least give some time to understand this game.
This is the best game ever ( ps. I move to hsr now )
loved it so much üî•
over talking
best game
"Played since version 1.0 and it was an amazing experience until Fontaine. the game quickly went downhill when Natlan came. World quests and lores are still great, but the newly characters are getting more like generic characters from other gacha games. The devs are not listening to the players at all, releasing more female characters that it's all now becoming a waifu/harem gacha game."
this game is very interesting üòÑ‚ù§Ô∏è and I advise any people play this game üí´‚ù§Ô∏è
very good game
"Can u guys, like, stop with the random ahh cutscenes? It's pmo so much while im exploring‚Ä¶ Also, the fs are out of control‚ÄîFontaine designs (and Fontaine itself) were and always will be peak."
my experience is amazing üòç
üå∑
"beautiful scenery, good character designs, interesting character kits, insane lore, but the fan service oh my gosh?especially after natlan it all went downhill, quick reminder that so many players have and will likely quit, especially players from 1.0"
ÿπÿßŸÑ€å
Too many charecters are unvoiced in EN... breaks immersion when one charecter talks and the other just stands there with a wall of text.
very nice game
best games
good game and he is fun
100s of hours of game play. just don't spend money and you're good üëç
"Honestly I'm disappointed. I've been playing since Spetember 2024, and im already in Fontaine but gosh. The devs are treating this game like the forgotten middle child. FOUR YEARS, and we finally got a free STANDART 5* selector. Meanwhile, hsr has better rewards. Like the rewards that is starting from HSR v 3.2, its way better than what genshin gave out for 4 years. I'm quitting. I cant play a game that doesnt care for their playerbase. Sure its great game but still. Not recommended."
Beautiful
it is a good game
the game is pretty good but it takes too long to download
Fun
"It's a pretty game with great music. The combat is decent--not much depth, but not very simple either. The open world is huge... and that's about it. The story is... meh. Not bad, not good either; it has a ton of inconveniences that just makes sure you spend hours just doing unenjoyable chores. No way to skip stories you don't like, while dialogue writing remains terrible. Time-gates progression, to ridiculous lengths. Gacha isn't bad, but gacha currency is absurdly scarce. Grinding takes weeks."
Awesome

must try game
"This was one of my favourite games from release until mid-2024, when they suddenly stopped caring about the previous storyline, and entirely ruined the ""fantasy exploration"" aspect of the game for something boring, unoriginal, and very questionable, not to mention the awful representation of the cultures that the new region is supposedly based on. I'm just... really disappointed, especially after putting so much time into this game."
Love the game on PC but the fact they still havnt added controller support on android yet makes combat unplayable. Edit: lowered the score due to quests bugging out and customer service will only help if I video the bug start to finish??? like how??? honestly screw this game
"Amazing storyline and graphics, taking players into a fantasy world"
Still the best one compare to other similar games.
very good
I love it!!!!! üòçüòç
live it nice game
This game had very good in graphic and especially the music.. The downside this game is artifact domain is really bad and wasting resin and time to farming.

PLEASE RECAST PAIMON'S VA I'M TIRED OF HEARING THAT ANNOYING PROBLEMATIC WOMAN
"I used to play this religiously for 4 years, daily. Don't waste your time with this. They are planning to replace voice actors with AI ‚Üí most voice actors are on strike. Do urself a favor and play smth that doesn't toss away their workers in favor of AI. They already fired Kinnich's old VA."
Best Game Ever üíØ It has now become my second home. Everything about it is perfect and heart-warming. I'm proud to have downloaded it for 4 years now.
does not provide rewards eww....
Takes at least a day to download
good
dev not listening and not improving . no skip button
very boring story
this game map is very large and interesting to do adventure
i like it
very very goodü•∞ü•∞ I like it
"Nice game, it is taking me to an unforgettable Journey. Thanks Genshin Impact! What a good Story!"
Developer can you optimise game more my phone lag so march on new archon quest kichina dominos you put flowers and tree this stuff is so lagged my mobile over all i don't have any problem thanks i think you can solve this problem
"it's been long time since English voice actor have a voice . It ruin my experience and change it do other voice and I happy with it. Some of English voice actor is so toxic and I hate them. I want all of them got recasted just like how kinich got. Expecting they own the character, play as victim , not doing work and try to manipulate the community they do this because don't want to get replace by ai . Nah , they all should be recasted they got what they deserve and expected at first place."
The game is going downhill and I would not recommend trying it. Half the characters lines are not voice in main quests and the developers just don't listen to the players. There's no skip button to skip through the bad writing silent story quests and the game is just getting stale.
"I love this game; if you don‚Äôt know about it, it‚Äôs like entering another world üò±üò±"

the game of future üòçü•∞üòò I love this game for its story graphics caractersüòò everything..
"have been playing since the very beginning, used to be my favorite game, i have well over 1300h in genshin and spent embarrassing amounts. So I'm quite confident to say that, to me, Natlan ruined the game. It's so unserious, the designs are really lacking compared to older designs. what happened from Fontaine to here? it seems like the game peaked and then went downhill. The ""Nation of War"" looks more like an UEFA advertisement. while beautiful visuals, it's a far cry from the potential it had"

"Even though It's Really Eating much storage and Taking too long to loadxIta pretty fun to play, I kinda got addicted when I Downloaded it days ago"
it's very vertical cool and nice it better than any game
"life service game with no improvement stuck to years it released, main point of it is to my you stuck with as long as it want"
Best game I have ever played
"Genshin please let us play in different servers , I play in Europe and my friend plays in Asia , this game is so long that starting in different servers will make it boring , please find a solution for this , please don't make me delete itüò≠"
i like Natlan
Great game . Thats it from UAE
Paimon english VA Corina Boettger has to go. Remove this hypocrite from the VA industry!

good game
"Natlan really flopped the whole thing... But at least there'll be a Mondstadt update and ngl.. The VA strike is disappointing especially the amount of VA's bullying Kinich's new VA and Candace VA being xenophobic? I feel bad for Kinich's new VA.. I hope Snezhnaya or Nod-Krai fixeds Genshin. But this is just my opinion, I enjoyed the game as much as y'all did."
Listen to old player too
it's very fantastic
"Disappointed because of less male characters in the game.. You're not making H@R3M type of game, and if you do so, you are so wrong in terms of marketing strategy, because people are getting tired of more female characters in the game. DO NOT GENERALIZED YOUR GAMERS COMMUNITY. Make your game balance between playable female and male characters."
"Dropping it down to two stars... Every new patch that comes out now just bring more waves of boredom and yawns. New characters are just devs serving fan services, the story is getting stale as it is being dragged on and on... I might move on to other titles at this point."

"I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH! The open world aspect is so much fun, the different nations are incredibly diverse, and the story and characters are just so good! This is my favorite game of all time!"
"I needed some thought to actually process the new region and what it was about. The topography, the colorism, nor the character writing makes sense in a fantasy adventure for an outlander's experience. P. S. Make Dottore playable please confirm it Hoyo."
it flopped.
"I used to love this game, it was fresh, new, and free on mobile. As someone who can't afford Zelda, it was a game changer for me. But it's disappointing that as time went on, every decision and lack of meaningful changes has made the game both feel bad and predatory. The last straw is when they started locking exploration behind premium characters. Sure there are alternatives to exploring the lands, but if they deliberately make it harder to traverse without said characters is messed up."
"Game nya bagus,harus ada free 999 Googolplex primo"
Extremely greedy company that does not listen to players and ignores issues.
"Best mobile game for Open World, Early of they kind and very Beautiful world builder. Other that? is Gacha! what do you Expect??"
this is nice game
"tbh I didn't like it, but I have nothing to do"
"This game company never address the constructive feedback of longtime player base and only ponders to new players. Ignoring or even censoring constructive criticism and refuse to implement requested quality of life updates and lack of meaningful endgame multiplayer content. I'm a day 1 player, AR60 and have supported the game financially since I truly believe in it's potential. Sadly they don't want to expand on this game after 3 years of feedback. I'm out."
not good game
"The pioneer of 3D Open world action RPG Gachas. It soared to the top during its launch and unfortunately, what goes up must come down. The current region, Natlan, is good in terms of the environment, the visuals, and the music. In terms of gameplay, it is still the Genshin that you played during COVID. Nothing has changed in the past 5 years. In terms of character design, they look out of place and should belong to another Hoyo game (HSR or ZZZ). Main story suffered a lot in terms of quality."
nice lore
the best game I ever played I love everything about it recommend
I love this game it's amazing and so many surprises i can't wait to see what's coming next
this game is amazing story

I loved playing the game it is really cool and I play it on my phone I heard people saying it is hard to play but I don't only have this game but honkai star rail and zenless zone zero which I love to play and on my opinion this game and all the other should win the best game for life

How come apple have controller support and android don't? Not changing my one star until controller support on Android. And give us skip button!!!!
"Desperately need skip button in story quest, its not really encouraging for player who havent play for a long time and see the quest piled up when they want to do thing faster/dont have time. Also i feel like new players might be overwhelmed with all the quest when they might be just interested in the newest region..."
nice
Quest has no voices. I don't like the conduct of your Paimon's EN VA. I literally don't want her voice heard again. the person is full of herself.
"Horrible storytelling. Inazuma's story arc is a hassle to get through because it genuinely feels like a toddler wrote the story. Same with Natlan, they pulled this ""Power of Friendship"" anime bullcrap, just made it feel flat and cheap. The expressions on each character are so boring and soulless with little variety. You're a multi-million, if not billion, dollar company that can't afford to improve the game that brings in the most of your revenue? It's pathetic."

this game made me feel freedom
the game perposly lower luck to pay for them
dawg im became poor guy
Amazing. Graphics are amazing!!! Gameplay is amazing and quests are fun.
yippe mobile controller support
Don't delete it plz
The developers never listen.
Make hu tao meta again
the game keeps closeing out on me
"The Genshin Devs/Publisher (Cognosphere/miHoYo) have provided the players with a subpar experience as of 5.0, locking exploration mechanics behind clunky saurians or by limited event (5-star) characters. Not to mention, in their game Honkai: Star Rail, they have implemented what is known as a ""global passive"" with their upcoming character. Meaning having this character or future ones with a GP gimmic will buff your account regardless to whether they are on your current team/lineup. GREED!"
good phone port
Wuwa better
Extrememly stupid in every concievable way and developers will always ignore its fanbase
Was good in 1.0
Been playing since 1.0 and in recent time the story quality has dropped to abysmal levels and character design of new female units seems to put fanservice as it's priority. The devs don't listen to player feedback as they value a quick cash-grab over player loayality
‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Bad 3rd anniversary rewards
love it
good
very good
Aburrido hasta las entra√±as.
Developers don't care about player feedback only penny pinching their customers
I like playing this game that it
nice
I love this game I played it for 3 years but I had to delete it because my phone didn't have any storage for the new update but I am a 100% sure I will download it again once I get a better gadget
best game love it ummha üòö
10/10 because it has femboy :)
Pretty fun
Game is Boring as of late attack animation is just a copy of one after another
Amazing
"genshin is definitely one of the most beautiful open world game out there and the combat and its concept is really engaging. But all that aside, all of the contents are boring. Once you reach a certain level, there isn't really anything to do. Yes, we can do quests and exploration, but doing some really long quest abd puzzles just for 30-40 primos doesn't feel rewardingat all. Not to mention the dialogues, the main story quest for the are doesn't even have voice acting."
"when you first download it it's prettycool,BUT it takes to long to load first thing when you get on it asks you to down!osd data or whatever,and takes five hours or something to finish.and everytime I'm done loading the thing.it keeps restarting the loading.please fix this I'll be playing GENSHIN impact cloud for now on. -thank you"
Best open world action rpg game edit: it's been years since playing this game and still it's content is soo good with each version and maps are expanding and amazing to üòÄ
QOF update for sanctifying elixir is trash. just made a emblem sands and it was already bad enough it was a 3 stat start it added salt to wound when it all rolled into hp%. This QOF update that needed a QOF update needs another. don't know how you could fumble a QOF not once but 2 times? just make the sanctifying elixir more easily obtained and allow for multiple of the set can be crafted in a single patch. QOF updates has been a joke after 5.0. can't wait to check past mail... absolute joke.
"very good graphics, music playing but wish vaise very poor only get weapons rarely one time charector getting this is minus point but my favourite game this only ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è"
"I would give it 5 stars just for the game itself, but I am reviewing the Genshin Impact game on the mobile Google Play Store. The game is great if you have the top tier best flagship phone with the latest processor but even with my phone (Galaxy S22), the game is unplayable and I can't get above 30 FPS even with the FPS set to 60 FPS and all settings on low. Edit: It works a lot better now on my S25 Ultra. The processor in the S22 series was known to have a poor thermal design that caused this."
"this is an amazing game ive been playing for almost 3 years now, i started playing for a character named kaeya and absolutely fell in love with the game, the character designs, lore, and activities are great and the game is wonderful. recently the new region of natlan came out and while it is different its still great, people are criticizing and saying things about the new characters being fan service but in reality its just the fandom making it that. great game overall and i totally recommend."
Players' time is not respected. From being the leading of overworld gacha games and now resting on their laurels after making it big. Grinding to build characters take too much time. Story writing taking a nose dive. Issues with voice acting in US unresolved. Predatory gacha.
amazing ü§©
nice
I love this game so far currently I am at ar 54
Nice game
"I used to play this game alot, it is quite fun and has very good music+scenery"
Would love for a skip button please. Dialogues during story quests or quests are just too time consuming.
dont play this game.. there is no skip button
its so good and the graphics are so fire! and my characters crit A LOT. thanks genshin!
"PLEASE JUST ADD ARTIFACT LOADOUT, THAT'S ALLL!"
"I'm back, so the racism is crazy, the weird jiggle physics on that cow girls guts are crazy. Disappointing and I give you a 0"
You're ignoring Player's Feedback

"Character designs are only targeting male players and it's getting obvious, other than that, the apps standing too much space I can't even run smoothly without deleting other important medias"
"This game is very good, but it requires a lot of memory. It requires 40 GB of memory."
I just love the game. It's story and everything
devs never listen
"No game is perfect and despite its flaws, genshin has been able to consistently do what a lot of products are unable to during intermissions, craft an enjoyable, light and casual experience that respects players' approach and time in the game. Coupled with a god tier soundtrack, engaging lore and the open world, I couldn't care less what haters had to say, it's five stars."
I love this game so much!!!üòçüòçüòç
some of genshin's en vas are so unprofessional üíÄ (specifically paimon's va) please replace these mediocre and immature vas asap.

"I played Genshin again and now i know why i always stop playing it, it is because every resources for upgrading Characters, Weapons, are restricted by time you can't just upgrade them there is a specific day for you to farm resources, ""Monday and Thursday"" , ""Tuesday and Friday"" and ""Wednesday and Saturday"" while there's no restrictions on ""Sunday"". because of this, it is very hard to raise their lvl specially the talent resources which is only available once a week.hayyst"

"It would have been 5 stars if it didn't have the problem . Lately the game is shutting down itself , once i was killing dvalin. pls fix this problem asap."
"An amazing game with a good storyline and graphics,though the content you have to download is large,it is worth it"
"Developers do not listen to the players' actual feedback (i.e., having artifact loadouts, buffing crystallize reaction, buffing older characters and weapons). Natlan concept (region, character, storyline) did not live with the expectation the developers built it up to be. Missing voicelines in English diminishes the enjoyment in playing the archon quests."
amazing game
"i love the gameplay and the quests sm, although the rewards are very underwhelming. i recently started playing this game and i didn't get much. that's the only aspect i hate. rest is great."
"There's only one big issues, it is the fact that the people behind this game does not listen to its fanbase. I'd like to mention how the game is introducing stronger and stronger characters as well as enemies, making older characters harder to use in the game. There's also events. Recently, the game has been forcing us to play characters by locking them in our teams instead of letting it be optional or giving very specific conditions to obtain certain buffs, this is from my experience, that is"
very good game
Some of the contents/events will require you a character from a specific region just for the buffs to work.
i hate natlan
nah
"Don't waste your time, this is garbage"
that's enjoying üòä
what's happening genshin?
Great game
I have a request my game is not loading. it only shows loading please do something I haven't played from last 2days
I love genshin impact it's so nice
Good game I am at AR 40 and I play in ps4 but please the ubdate on ps are EXTREMELY large please make them lower like lower them from 40gb to 10gbüòäüòä but overall very good would recommend to all peopleüëåüëåüëçüëçedit in 2023 I am now still updating genshin on my ps4 is 10gb now it was 40GB...

i like this game
it's very nice game it's graphics and views are amazing .....

I like this game but I won't be able to open it anymore it keeps showing me loading screen and its won't open until I use vpn genshin do something about it

I like the game but it takes up too much storage
lore n graphics so good
"3 fates. Take it or leave the game! Now they decide to do new 2 units, double banner. There's free 20 pulls AFTER the banner. Now y'all wanna know who's scummy? It's the worst predatory gacha ever in history of gacha games."
the best game I ever play !it's far better that all adventure games it's graphics are good if you want to increase your graphics quality you can watch on youtube it's characters ability are like a god it's beautiful animation are like an anime fight it's a good game you can play with friends it's map is 50 time bigger than bgmi erangel it's the best game I ever played üí†üëå
"It's a great game. The only problem is giving up on wish or Premo, or we can say that the system of characters that gives it too late to wish you can collect during the game."
It's really good
hehe wuwa is better XD
I will give GI a 4 star because it's my comfort game of all time. I didn't give it a five because there's a lot of QoL that we need like a skip button please give it to us and we need more end content because there is nothing to do left if you're ar 58 above also we need a buff for outdated characters like kokomi and venti being left out in meta please buff THEEEMMMM!!!üòòüòòüòò
"Buat map baru di V5.5 ini bagus banget sih,kerasa banget natlannya"
Very interesting and Mysterious game storyline ü§î
A very good game but NOT for gambling addicts
"in full honesty it's just sexualizing characters. the woman show a lot of skin, the size is just idk. it's disappointing. the woman are just being sexualized. The chests the clothing the style, ur guy's clothing choices for them. you guys could do way more better. if you want people to like ur game that bad, respect culture, race, and not sexualize woman."
"The lore is ecstatic, the intents among the characters are.. outright just disgusting. (the fan service is becoming progressively bothering), the music on the other hand is a banger, while the fanbase is just.. literal degenerate kindergartners, but they're honestly not to blame for that considering how valid their claims are, that doesn't make this game any better though. 2/5, needs to improve on that sector, because no way in hell is anyone appreciating the fan service, please improve on that."
"i wish the devs would add armor systems, I'd love to see my character with different looks and become more stronger through armors and perhaps, enchanted once. im pretty sure this would change how genshin is being played significantly good"
"Getting primogems is SOO hard. As an f2p, its really hard to catch up with the meta when its literally changing every update and i cant do anything about it because i dont have primos!! AND I JUST LOST MY 50/50. Thanks a lot hoyo"
very little reward
"Sorry hoyo for those who gave genshin 1 star review, they're just crying about small this.. genshin is still the best"
"I love this game so much I started playing this at 2022, I quitted, and haven't played for 3 years now, so i decided to play it again, the only thing I don't like about this game it takes 3 days for the download resources to finish, even tho my WiFi is good and my storage is not bad. üíî"
GENSHIN IMPACT IS THE BEST GAME SO FAR FOR ME. I love you mihoyo ralat : stupid game. to much talking...
IT A VERY NICE GAME EVERYONE SHOULD PLAY THIS
love it.
"I played this game since release, used to love everything about it and given that this is a free game the graphics and gameplay is beyond amazing. however lately it has become very slow, character designs are too fan serviced and genshin seems to have lost its spark. I'm giving it 2 stars because it still has potential, but with the release of Natlan and (in my opinion) since Sumeru the game has grown dull."
I like it but I hope genshin impact focuses on male characters like most of the five star characters release are mostly female
This is my one of the favourite game genshin impact
"I've played this game since day one and, even though I missed out on the majority of Version 1, I still love this game. The gameplay fits my needs as a casual player perfectly, the soundtrack is one of the best I ever heard in any game, the visuals are amazing, and the story as well. Unfortunately, Version 3 made me play less until today because I was a bit tired of the Archon Quests and the desert exploration, but Fontaine and Natlan are/were refreshing to play and explore after Sumeru."
"I was a whale, spending thousands of hard earned money for pulls. After one patch the character became weak due to tweaks. It exploits the use of micro transactions to get characters, and even then you have a low chance of getting a character. The combat is repetitive, with not much variety in each of the different characters. The visuals are poor and outdated. The story telling is very confusing and you can't skip scenes."
this game so fun
lovely graphics
Bro it's not letting me delete this game.

the animation üòç and quality of this game is really great
great game with an amazing story and characters

"this game singlehandedly made me despise gacha for such a long time because of how bad the system was. the farming aspects are extremely boring, exploring just feels dull, some quests take an unholy amount of time to finish, especially the world quests that have no voices from the characters which makes the quests even more boring, the puzzles require sherlock level thinking skills to solve and don't even get me started on the powercreeps on both characters and artifacts. no skip button either."
"Well, I'm still here. I'm still enjoying. Even with the lack of husbandos (CMON HOYO) & lack of free primogems, I know I'll still play this until the end. Though, it wouldn't hurt if you give more primos to your players. More mini-quests & fun puzzles pls. I will get back to spending if you bring back more husbandos in this game. Thank you for finally increasing the Teapot load!! Still, Kudos to all staff!"
"I have to give less stars now that the gameplay has been stale for too long without new combat mechanics and endgame content. EDIT 31/03/25 : Natlan is a fresh experience and Act 4 was especially amazing. But the pacing and storytelling of Act 5 is a bit weird, I'm still keeping 3 stars for now."
it's best even for beginners
love this game fantasy's and amazing story's and voices thank u hoyoverse for this amazing game
nice game
ok
this game is really good. It has its downs but deserves 5 stars
I love the game
I love this game it's so open world and action and parkour and gliding but unfortunately It TAKES 32 GIGABYTES but it's worth it please try the game it won't disappoint
nice adventure so far in the beginning
Please listen to your players' feed back.
Bring back the English Va's
"hey hoyoverse if you can recast Keqing VA, Candace Va, and Especially Paimon then I might consider grinding your game once again sharing everything from my experience cause I seriously don't like a game where the majority of characters are muted it's frustrating to only hear Paimon annoying voice while the important character are muted or went absolute Silent it is a great game but the issue with the voice acting is absurd it's already 1 year and a half. come on I still love this game"
the best
I luv it soooooooooo much!! the world is soooooo pretty and the character designsssss!!!!! but they need more hot boys!!!üéÄüå∏üå∑
Addictive and good
+1 for controller support
best game ever
too much fan service xoxo
"3rd anniversary, things are getting pretty good :)"
Honestly the one of the best open world games out there. Dont pass it if youre looking into downloading it even if its huge and takes up a lot of space its worth it.
good game but some glitch need to fix overall good physics I rate 5.
This game sucks because it only works with a controller what a iPhone 12 controller doesn't work for Android that's why I think this game sucks big time and they are never going to fix it it because those people too damn cheap to have it where you can play what a controller on Android but at least it works on PS5 and PC
love this game from very beginning. but the exploration needs better experience for user.
Fantastic!
"I really like the game and everything I'd give it 5 stars but I always lose my 50/50 and stuff, I won it one time in almost two yearsüò≠,but other then that the story and quality are amazing."
"I am quite disappointed with the recent versions because first of all, I didn't feel the genshin feels with the storylines you've presented. it feels forced and I don't know, just cringed. then I hate your character designs. yes, it's vibey but its against to how you've explained the nation to be closed off from the outside world. third, too much fanservice for the men. can you just tone it down a bit and maybe release five star men with fun playstyle? l can't believe it's only kinich and ifa"
"Been playing consistently since 2.5, and we're now at 5.5. To say this game has lost its charm would be an understatement. Increasingly convoluted mechanics get added, quests focus on one-off NPCs that spew an endless amount of dialogue you can't skip, playable characters are skewed more and more toward fan service in addition to female characters severely outweighing male ones in the past year. HYV doesn't listen to their international player base, they make silly changes that nobody asked for."
Mid
whatever they say this is the game I enjoy to play and love.

"I've been playing this since 2021, and still playing it daily. I still love everything about the game even during the Natlan update."
"I LOVE genshin, it's an amazing game with STUNNING graphics, but since the Natlan arc, it kind of feels like the characters are designed to be more fanservice, rather than have interesting lore and characteristics. by the way,I HATE how I have to finish the chasm quests before starting the chasm archon quest, because the world quest is genuinely so long and boring üò≠ Also, primogems are SO HARD to get nowadays"
"Okay editing my review after 3 years of playing. There is no hope for this game. worst devs, no improvements, extremely greedy. Only people still praise this are fanatics who have spent a lot of money on this already and paid content creators"
Not good QoL
"kicks me out... before i can even enter the first city. too big for most phones to handle, and while the graphics may be great, phones aren't built for them. if you really want to play, you should probably just play on something else."
I LOVE FURINA...
I give this game one star because you hoyo careless about genshin players
Improve the rewards
for now I'm using JP voice over. hoyoverse should just kick out the problematic english Voice Actors and recast Eng VA outside of US
"This game has a lot of potential, but the devs are kinda selfish and don't listen to the players, and the reward for every quest is so small, not f2p friendly ."
Wow
asks for feedback but proceeds to ignore feedback.
"I'm OBSSESED with this game[frfr] I've play genshin around 2.0 but I'm not an og that much since I always was too lazy to play to back then, but genshin will always be my favorite adventure game from the space of my heart, till I complete the whole game, I'll be retiring but right now all I have to say it's a really fun interactive amazing game!^^ so much to learn so much lore and theories, mwamwa"
overall good gameplay but as a mobile player myself you should play it on PC or console
Dev never listen
why can't I login with my facebook account
"I've been playing for hours and hours now. It's impressive how it's written and animated ‚Äî it's as if I were really a here in a story! Though, it would be nice if there was an autistic-friendly option. All the tons of info that I get at a time are... overwhelming. I'll give 5 stars, but only because I can't give 6!"
Open world was amazing but community and characters are all gay and strange so deleted it. It's a shame this map could've have been used to make the best mobile game ever .
"i lost 50/50 4 times in a row, wanna make it 5?"
good open world and graphics game
This game is my most favourite game as it is the only game that have best graphics and the starting of the game is very gorgeous üòçü•∞ but the from yesterday I am facing an issue where It gets stuck at loading screen and after about 5 minutes it says unable to login so please fix this issue
"This games have gambling mechanic I don't recomand for children. I like this style. Bad optimization, eat the battery -_- I recomand this game is fun. But the co-op is bad.."
"Really good experience, good rewards but the Inazuma map has really strong enemies an I feel like they should be balanced,an another thing beating those strong enemies give common chest while beating hilichural at monstad gives a exclusive chest I feel like this is a big scam"
"This game has the potential to be one of the best mobile games but it keeps ruining it by not listening to it's consumers, making all the new female characters fan service and the Natlan region is as if it is from another game, the character design in Natlan are so stupid it doesn't fit the world of teywat, the resighn is too little, there is no way to save any of the resighn that you couldn't use one day, no skip bottun for the long, boring and unimportant dialogues and so many more..."
trash game also gooner devs
I don't like how the company treats it's employees and how problematic the game is overall and how bad genshin is at listening to their players. also I don't like their use of AI.
"HONESTLY IDC ABOUT THE STORAGE THE GAME IS WORTH IT, THE QUEST MAY BE HARD BUT ITS FUN BTW FOR THOSE WHO WANT TO DOWNLOAD LET ME REMIND YOU ITS 35GB UP BUT ITS WORTH IT I RECOMMEND FOR THOSE WHO HAVE 128GB UP PHONES AND TABS/IPADS, ITS BETTER THAN ANY GAMES"
"I am play game it's amazing, wonderful game , adventure and mission graphics cool gaming I like this game"
I love it
pretty good
best game ever
"in ancient mountain path on stone dragon "" Touch "" option didn't appear I think it is some kind of glitch I restart the game but didn't solve please do something."
"I can't open my app after reinstall? Pls help, I dun wanna miss the limited time primogem"
"Best game with epic cutscences, the reward hav greatly increase and with the addittion of Natlan has introduced numerous fun mechanics bit could we get a. free 10pulls pls I need varesa"
love it favourite game
Amazing game absolutely love it kinda femboy/gay fanbase but overall this game is more than just good
i love it but the storage consumption is just.. killing my 64gb phone..
op

The Gacha system sucks I spent 4800 primogems and get all garbage not a single 5star character. I will stop playing this whole season and the transmuter make the notifications off I HATE IT I love the game but the Gacha literally sucks and fake at least rewards is with something. I will rate 5 stars later Thanks for the fix of the new update
with anime themed games and open world is also quite light this is my favorite game
"THIS GAME IS GREAT!!but I have a problem I can't open the game and whenever I try to open it it kicks me out the other apps don't kick me out for example:""honkai star rail doesn't kick me out like genshin pls fix this thankss! and it say theres a bug i wish you could fix this thanksss"
"By playing this game, it feels like I have entered the world of anime. Those who watch anime should definitely play this game once. I really enjoyed playing this game ü´†"
"too much resources, but it is indeed a great game. ü•∞"
everytime i play on my phone the app closes
great graphics
"AS THE TIME PASSES this game completely change lmao, It looks like i am playing A Child game compared to other game like Wuthering waves which is More challenging, way less Boring, and every patch feels new. lmao genshyt -1000 star for this game"
they fired the best employee who good at fill up communities request and boost the the game now they turn thing over not recommend to play sooner or later it for pay to win the rough enemies without testing only put and grind
"Incredible, I love the story and the Adventure we have with our travel companion. The only problem was the space it takes on mobile phones or laptops so I download it on my PS4 but the upgrades every month needs 75g internet yeah it was the only problem but it's a great game now I'm gonna play other games from Hoyoverse too such as Star Rail"
"Genshin is a great open-world game, and it's gameplay is awesome. Natlan's aq storyline is really entertaining. The only thing is that getting primos takes SO MUCH TIME but I think that's just cuz I'm bad at the game lol"
It's pretty good
ig it's fun
amazing game! I like the art style used in the game and the overall character design!
"Genshin is the BEST game i ever played, seen, watched. Just, amount of characters, places, interaction, its just too good! ONLY one problem - 31 GB for a game, minimum graphics. But thats not a big problem to me tho. Anyways, 5* for upcoming Capitano"
I love the game soooooooooooooo much BUT it has an issues when I was playing the archon quest liyue it said that find a place to see the sigil . I did but it didn't continue that's weird welp I hope you fix it :)
its great but i still feel its lacking
dem kinda cool
you've changed üòû
recast eng vasü•∞
I'm so excited how it is!!
Needs controller support
i never been seen a game like this. this is the best of the bestest game i ever played.
It is better than I expected
worst game in the world it 32gb to play the game
good game I like it
"can you stop with the freaking power creep? Almost every event require nightsoul burst even the spiral abyss, its unfair for those who dont have natlan character"
STOP MAKING THIS GAME GOONER BAIT
2 days for download recorces
IM GETTING ADDICT
game is top notch but y do I have error 4201 when my wifi is 50 mbps
"version 5.5 boasts that it has android controller support, doesn't work on my android device. uninstalled"
Please hurry up and add the Arabic language
Hi everyone thanks for playing
wow
"lots of hot chicks and fan service. perfect üëå and as a bonus a good story. the dubbing is a little rough at times, only complaint."
old quest the very beast buttttt new play game nott gooddd
i like this
I'm so sad how much this game has fallen. RIP Genshin welcome WUWA!
great game! but why can't I get in the game? it always says I'm on security risk and I haven't played for a long time please do something!
this uses too much storage tho but it's VERY GOOD
üëç
"I loved playing Genshin for three years, but lately, the content has been a bit boring lately. Especially with a lot of the English voice actors not even being there. And even the rewards and primos are little."
"im a bit petty, but Hoyoverse, how are you gonna make me lose the 50/50 on my BIRTHDAY. I just wanted the featured character"
this game is even though I didn't play it yet but I see it a lot I can't play because my phone is weak and also my internet is weak I hope she would be nice to my phone and thank you ‚ô•Ô∏è
"Great game! however do note its Powercreep heavy! if you dont spend money, you will not get far even as a F2P or low spender!"
"very draining, don't get me wrong. I like their designs and gameplay, but the fact you can get so little of a time-consuming events and quests. and you have to pull for like 100 just to get ONE gold pull is CRAZY I just wanted a cosy game for my free time since I have a LIFE! this game wants a pay to win situation so bad!"
RNG Suck
"Grafik yang indah!!. Apalagi saat explore Fontaine musiknya, cerita archonnya yang semakin menarik di Fontaine. GG dah pokoknya"

"Just like last year, they've put out another 10/10 region. From the gimmicks to the characters to the abilities and everything in between is perfect. This time, we got the most cinematic Archon Quest yet. The main World Quest storyline came with several mind bending reveals that has once again changed everything we knew about Teyvat."
"Best game in the world I recommend this game to all those who like open world games, great story, great graphics, interesting and varied characters, you will never get tired of the game. I thank the creators of the game, thank you."
that's great....
I looooove this game It's so cool and much fun
Its a hit and miss which is expected of a gacha game . But i guess it does fuel enough of a gambling addiction. Anyway the good parts are good and the lows when its gets repetitive are there too and if u think ur lucky sure give it a roll .
Amazing. This game is just simply amazing.
"This game is good but HORRIBLE!!! The creators of the game do NOT care about their community and only caters to them when their wallets are threaten. I remember being excited, when I was told we were getting free 5-stars characters of our choosing. However, they just gave us one 5-star character to shut us up. Mihoyo, please either care about your community more or most of everyone will get bored and the game will die out. Also, any other game companies looking to collab with this game DON'T!!!"
"I played this game almost everyday for almost 5 years, it's awful don't play it."
Best game ever played in mobile it's almost like I m playing in little pc a compact PC graphics storyline everything is awesome just if we can adjust the custom HUD controll it would be much more great but it still good
well I Really fun when u get to play but the STORAGE!!!!
"my favorite game so far it has the best graphics and it's worth playing, but it's really laggy for android users and my phone is not even that old.. i got it 2 years ago so the game should run just fine but for some reasons it's ***REALLY*** laggy.. it's insane.. i have set my graphics to the lowest quality and it's ***STILL*** laggy! no pls fix this issue.. asap"
"my stuff has been powercrept, it's way too grindy and eventually the grind isn't worth the repetitive gameplay.."
"I still love genshin graphics, musics and combat elemental reaction gameplay but after playing for almost 4 years I kinda bored with slow story progress with long storyline to wait for finish, less immersion feeling on storyline for these patch and repetitive events and activities, tiring grinding artifacts with low chance best results but still recommend for new players enjoy this game and take your time to enjoy it"
‚ò∫Ô∏è
It's lore is very addicting and the characters have beautiful designs
I love it
"why it takes forever to compile shaders, even with snapdragon 8s gen 3 , with 256 , 12 gb ram"

Awesome! Feels like i m the main protagonist in an isekai anime lmfao! Enjoying it alot! Also there r number of waifus üòÅ! Best game sooo far! Less game more anime. Lol.. Give it a shot. Also don't hold back just bcs its size is 30gb. Make storage space n just start downloading!
"awful lore and story progression, awful dev-player relationship and awful powercreep now has entered the chat as well! I don't recommend ANYONE getting into this game if they already haven't and I encourage you to leave if you have. it's a soul sucking parasite with barely any upsides. if you miss BoTW, go replay that instead. if you like the music it's available on Spotify. there's a million reasons why not to install this cash cow poor excuse of a game. it's a shame I can't go lower than 1star"

I downloaded it and i still need to keep downloading and downloading and downloading bro just send a notification that's it's done with downloading I spend 31 giga bites nah this deserves a 1 star bro fix it

"I installed it hoping for a good game, but it had to install over 20+ GB of additional files, and it didn't say that when I installed it, and it almost killed my phone."
"i wanna give it a 0, seriously, what is this game? the gameplay is ok, but all the archon quests are just talking, and the story is so boring and dumb, its not entertaining or fun, and you even have to pay money? then you replaced writers with ai, like just stop the talking SERIOUSLY, I DO NOT CARE. and you cant even skip. stupid game."
"I love playing this game because of the game mechanics, the open world to explore I mean I am enjoying the new update a lot."
"Hi! lumine user here, I love this game, but I'm disappointed about all the favouritism that's being given to: aether and hsr, as a aether lover as well, it's kinda upsetting that lumine doesn't get ANY attention, and hsr.. DID YOU SEE THE REWARDS?? Like please, genshin is one of hoyo's best running games, PLEASE GIVE US GENSHIN PLAYERS AT LEAST A BIT MORE REWARDS, AND there are BARELY any young boys and 0 liyue hydro ladies, 0 mondstadt dendro characters, etc, like hoyo, I beg, please fix it üò≠"
It was amazing the gameplay the characters were perfection
definitely a good game with good experience
excellent

"used to be a good game in 2021-2023 but now there are too many new characters. Side quests etc take WAY too long. Boring Events and stuff like that..Let's not forget that there are barely any good re-runs like Klee and ganyu. I used to play everyday but now I log in once a month to pull, but not even that is fun anymore. The banners are bad and always the same New characters. The game had a huge downgrade. 2/10."
really vibrant graphics

Nice game
it is a good game
This game is great the only problem I have is the camera angles while battling multiple enemies camera automatically shifts to weird angles blocking the proper view while fighting and if you are surrounded by enemies sometimes it becomes difficult to leave attack button to adjust camera angle.
Add the dam skip button
I like the characters and the stories but I don't like when I have to wait to complete a story quest like the new story right now but I still love your game
oke lah
Beautiful game but with the opponent difficulty is crazy impossible missions makes it worst experience for me and unskipable dialogues and why upgrading characters are so difficult
trash reward and very stingy with pull
"too many gooners, I hate this game, I've been playing since 2.2 there's nothing cool about it SINCE NATLAN UPDATE. genshin lost their fantasy vibe, hoping snezneya will be cooler than NATLAN + I hope the archon is not aether fangirl kawai uwu PLSSSSSS >:( and thx for the venti rerun, I miss him, gimme kokomi mihoyo and BANSOS PLSSSSSSS masa jdi anak tiri trs siiihhhh, game sebelah di manja¬≤ kita di jadiin anak tiri :((((((((((((((((((((((( pls daweiüôè"

This game is absolutely amazing! but then I logged in to my one and only main account that is logged to Google and my AR rank got reset to the beginning and my whole entire characters and game data got reset too. please fix this problem Hoyoverse...
it's fun
Natlan ruined the entire game. everyone just got powercrepted it's not fun to play anymore and don't even get me started on the fan service. Also the Natlan weekly boss sucks ahh
i love it i love the characters and my sons enjoyed playing it i recommend to play it
ever since I was a kid I have been wanting to play this game and I had just recently started playing this and it is the best everrr
hu tao is PEAK characterüó£Ô∏èüî•üî•üî•
"I played this game for almost 4 years, but recently after 5.2 update, the game is getting worse and worse day by day. The amount of fan service is getting disturbing, disrespectful and mostly disgusting; New characters' dmg just broke the game and everything's becoming impossible to do with previous characters; new events are just DUMB and not fun AT ALL. tbh they really did some good updates for building system but everything else is falling apart so quickly. I hope next nation be better..."
absolutely phenomenal 10/10 recommend
one of the worst gacha out there never playing hoyo games is one of the best decisions u will ever make!!!
nice
5.5 update is worse. Game crushing a lot.
best game literally for 3d game
Arena ¬∑ Version Events. Genshin Impact is now on Xbox! Come chat with Paimon! Game News. X.
AMAZING
predatory gacha system. natlan char design strays from the overall theme of the game.

"this game is ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL!I really love the storyline,lore, graphics and the designs!I love this game so much,I used to play it everyday but my storage is full so I delete the app,I keep on using genshin impact cloud so I could play,but the queue is toooooo longg,so I decide to download it on my tablet.so far...THIS IS MY FAVOURITE GAME OF ALL TIMEEE.but there's a major problem,for the people who have done all quest,they have nothing to do.I hope dis game will always be the BESTGAME BYEE"

the best game
It's good inall but it for some reason it deleted my account even though I never deleted it.
The stories sucks and too long.. waste more than one hour for just 60 primogem... Please at least add skip button for the stories....üòÆ‚Äçüí® why did honkai star rail and Zenless zone can easily give player stellar jade and polychrome and free 10 pull every patch... meanwhile genshin could never...

"Overall, it's a good game. Good voice acting, great storyline, etc. But there are just a lot about it that's not good. It takes up a lot of storge, there's too much fanservice, the game is racist (from what I heard), and it's not too f2p friendly. I loved genshin, specifically during Fontaine, but now... Genshin just isn't that great anymore."
"I honestly love the game and I always have. The lore is amazing and so are the characters. I really don't get why people hate on Natlan so much, it's a great nation, it's just that it's not as good as Fontaine doesn't make it bad."
"replacing va's bc Hoyo refuses to sign a no-ai agreement, refusing to create characters of color, lack of QOL updates, insane grind and powercreep, and even the story and characters suck now. genshin is creatively bankrupt but still stingy on rewards and pulls. take your time and money elsewhere to other games that actually respects players & the cultures that inspire their lore. if I could give 0 stars I could."
This game is good but there are lots of hackers who hack your ID whenever your rank is above 50 ar or 55 with higher crit rate and crit damage and the game doesn't take action against these hackers That's why this game is the worst I request take some action against hacker
just downloaded the game and it was cool and all but my storage was NAWT coolüòî so much things needed to download ngl AAAAA
I love this game soo much but I want to be able to play it without Internet I don't know if you have control over that but if you do then please do something about this.
good
very nice open world
best game ever
"bro I've been playing this game for like 4 years now and in my personal opinion- I. LOVE. IT. It's 100% been my favourite game for the whole 4 years!!! and it still is. The designs, graphics, lore and everything perfectly meets my expectations!! I lovee the details hoyo puts into Genshin Impact, I hope this game never ever ends :)"
"The game was fine in the begining and peaked during the fontaine arc last year but ever since the release of natlan they switched up things entirely, the characters are terribly written designs are just racist and they decided to target the game a lot more towards incels so all the characters look like they came straight out of a dating sim, they also made the characters powercreep others a lot more, even tho I don't think it's nearly as bad as hsr I def wouldn't recommend this game."
This game was great until they decided their voice actors didn't deserve AI protection and they decided to recast some of those who are on strike. Shame on you. I'm done playing this game until the strike is over.
Very good interesting fun ND exciting game with many possibilities
"When I try changing the password through email, I don't get the verification code but when I press the resend button, that is when the previous code will be sent to my email which makes it impossible for me to log on my account"
Game is fantastic
best
nice game but the storage is so big
"i give it one because you lied to us players for example the santifying elixir in version 5.5 is a scam it nerfs the crit rolls into two rolls max, man you shouldn't do that ""FIX"" this"
5.5 new area is ABSOLUTE CINEMA ‚úãÔ∏èü•πü§ö
The scenery is beautiful

this so beautiful guys Download it now

"Finally, allow android to use the controller to play genshin. I can finally use a controller for my tablet. Play is very smooth and love the storyline play."
I love it soooo muchü§©I love this game it's so fun and explore and soo cute of course
"I'm not a big fan of the natlan lore, unlike the other nations I didn't really feel some sort of attachment to anyone or anything."
I played this game when version 2.1 was out it was fun at first but the fan service is disgusting especially since most of the characters are women and hoyo started sexualising the characters more I suggest not playing this game
BANYAKIN KARAKTER COWOO ü§¨
"This game is so cool and the story, it's bring me a anime storyüòÑ"
too good
"AMAZINGG i love the story line and the characters, specially Venti (ik that didnt need to be mentioned) my only problem with this is this takes up like 70% of my storage causing me to uninstall it now, but I'll re-install it again someday! loll, totally recomended if you have a high storage phone and want a cool game with an amazing story lineeee!"
muy pocas protogemas no tiene voton de skip si no te interesa la historia igualmentr te tienes que tomar 1 o 2 horas de dar click sin parar las animaciones son pochas muy pocas protogemas no escuchan ala comunidad y no meten buenas actualizaciones al juego (llevo jugando 3 a√±os) mejoren el juego porque osino siguiran perdiendo jugadores
majestic brilliant pretty prettiest beautiful beyond explanations
THIS IS AN AMAZING GAME
awesome
very good game
the best game I ever played
genshin could never
it's really good
this game i had so much hope to play and try but now knowing its almost 20gb i guess that will stay as just as a mere hope....üòë
Very Bad .
"add a skip button some side quests take 7hrs ,6 hours of that is talking"
üòóüëå Perfection. Fighting: 10/10 Character designs/personalities: 10/10 Storyline: 10/10 Conclusion: Love it. Would recommend.
"I don't even know where to begin... the game has just gotten so tedious to play. Exploring isn't fun when movement feels so slow and restricted, and a lot of quick exploration features are paywalled behind characters. Everything in the game requires resin to build characters, yet no resin overflow system. Recently, character design has also plummeted. Way too much focus on NPC dialogues and stories in a lot of world quests despite the lack of diverse NPC models and designs. No skip button."
pait ng rewards
"genshin really lost its fantasy feeling with all the new updates, the new natlan characters haven't really matched with the fantasy theme, riding a gun in the air? motorbike? what happened to using their elements to advantage instead of machines? genshin had great potential, sadly it was ruined.."
hey j got furina now thanks
all i can say this is an AMAZING game
i js redownloaded it and when i came back i cany open my acc so i tried forgetting the password but everytime it gives me a verification code it gives it to me 5 mins late
no android controller support still.
"please reduce the size of the game, i can't play it anymore :""("
dropped the ball
look if you have low device so don't download this because this game is more then 30 gb but game is very goodüëç
"The company behind this game, Hoyoverse, does not listen to its players. I've played this game for 4 years straight, 100%ed everything, have amazing teams and builds. I used to love the story, the characters, the world, but ever since Natlan, it's changed. Horrendously. It's just not worth it. I feel disrespected as a player. So I'm done with this company."
"I love playing, but Natlan is sucksss!!"
the way this game goes about cultural representation is concerning
"natlan is getting a lot of hate, but its inspired by the black panther. xilonen is their great inventor, like shuri, and mavuika is like the black panther, where tye role of pyro archon is passed down through generations. phlogisten is like vibranium, please understand that the nations of teyvat are inspired by real life areas and places!!"
"I've played this game for years now and it has been great with all the exciting stories, cutscenes, characters. Not until Natlan arrived. Ever since Natlan came, there has been a change of almost everything to the point, it doesn't feel like Genshin Impact (In a bad way). The new characters feel boring and uncreative, not even their character trailer helps. The music was good but not as good with the other nations. And style has changed so much, where it's just foreign to me."
"worst game , didn't return my account after begging for ages after it got hacked , trust the hacker more than me even with photos and in game details , played for 4 years AR60 , now I miss my account but happier without genshin in my life , game is hell in disguise newcomers beware"
I like it üëç
I love the game but my storage can't handle how big the game is maybe you guys could try and minimize it a bit
"Genshin Impact is an amazing story telling game that has great combat versatility, interesting puzzles, stunning gameplay, and more. I suggest playing it to get a feel for the game. of course, not every game is perfect as it too has major flaws. There are many issues such as the gambling aspect which seems very pushy and others such as the companies incompetence to listen to the community. however, in an ever changing environment, I'm sure it'll grow for the better (hopefully)"
"Has been amazing fun up until now. I can't give it 5 because I'm very worried about the direction the game is going in, but overall it's good"
it's the best game ever
its my opinion but for me its disturbing : their mouth movement with the sound language are not in syn.. maybe you could say its not a big deal but at wuthering waves atleast the are in sync..
Good game
5/4 good graphics and world but gets boring gets repetive and grinding day and night
best rpg explore game ever
"I play since around 2.8 and l loved the game it was amazing the characters, lore, playstyle, nations and the community. But now it doesn't fell the same anymore. The community became more toxic. Lore is getting more and more boring. The power creep is huge and every new natlan character power creeps another one. Characters designs are a bit off aswell not saying they weren't really revealing back them but now it seems worse. I just hope that they will listen more to the players and they feedback"
good
"Hoyoverse as a company is one of the greediest companies within the gacha space, and that's saying something. Anyone who respects themselves should not play any of their games. This has been true of Genshin for years and more recently, HSR is in the same boat."
One star review until they add controller support for Android.
it's better than honkai: global passive.
"Lovely online game, it's only adventure game I love"
ABSOLUTE CINEMA (üôÇ+üï∂Ô∏è=üòé)
"have fun with the mail QoL, what a s2pid game this is"
"worst game ever, filled with disgusting fanservice, never listening to the players or their feedback, boring, repetitive, annoying new characters. I'm so disappointed and UPSET over this."
it is nice
trash
Nice game √ó best open world game for me ‚úì
"I had been playing the game since May 2023. Yes, powercreep is real in this game. As a dolphin user, who has only spent on the welkin pass. I will say since I've three accounts. I eventually achieved getting 36 stars in the spiral abyss twice on my main acc. I'm working on towards theater another endgame in genshin. It was worth the wait. This game does come with flaws. The QoL in this update has made beginners easier for themselves to play."
if I don't get varesa even after topping up for the first time ever in my life I will end my life and it will be your fault
it is amazing
pretty good game love the story and design can get boring to grind but worth it
This game is very adventurous game graphics is so cool and my favourite game üéÆ
Great game ‚ù§Ô∏è
here's the thing I like it but the characters are hard to get if only it was easier to get characters then I would change it to 5 stars
QOL sucks! They just want your money.
No skip button Powercreeping is too bad New events are gatekeep behind new char. Been playing this game since release and now will just drop it.
"Mostly played on PC and PS5, only played on mobile for the dailies. But the gameplay has been super fun and engaging, open world full of little puzzles and rewards, plus interesting story and attractive characters."
it took 31.2 GB of my storage
Love itttt
"Greatest Rpg mobile game ever. I mean it has such a deep lore, great action and quests. It's Great"
bro its so good i can even lie very recommended please pull for wanderer if you download this game
"still my favorite game! exploration, combat, events :D"
is my third best game I play in my life ever
The game is good overall.Natlan was kinda off i had higher expectations.The Pyro archon design wasn't that good.I expected a really aggressive person to be the Pyro archon with good design of course Not having a weird bike. But the 5.5 version update is better than other regions. The new area is good And another very huge problem in Genshin impact is that it doesn't have any skip button. I would highly recommend adding a skip button in game if not in archon or story quest but in world quest.
this is a great game
"ok so I'm changing my rating from 5 to 3, genshin really did us dirty with Natlan"
i will always love this game despite how the fandom is thanks for your hardworksss
"It is the best üòç game I've ever play. I just wanna thank to Hoyoverse for making such a beautiful, gorgeous, and masterpiece game. The graphics, art style, characters, and the places are so beautiful, that I've got addicted to it. Just love ‚ù§Ô∏è it!!"
my favorite game tbh
amazing‚ù£Ô∏è
I love playing Genshin
it's just ugggh can't even go to my menu without dying and hard to do quest and it give u baby amount of crystals to use for wishes and littraly just frustrating
ABSOLUTE CINEMA!!!!
"I love this game so much! This is my fav game so far. The graphic is so sick and beautiful. All of the content such as combat, lore wise and exploration makes it even more fun to play. However, pls increase the primogems rewards for this game... As an f2p, I really need so much primogems to pull for a character that I want. Also, please make Windtrace event as a permanent event. I'm begging youüôèüèª"
Bring back Kinich's VA John back. ‚úãÔ∏è Absolutely no offence to Jacob but he does not give off the accurate vibes for Kinich.
We don't support scabs here. Revert the recast of Kinich.
"I started playing Genshin around the time it was originally released. It had beautiful landscapes and a meaningful storyline. I stopped playing regularly and spending money around the release of Sumeru. I still play a bit at a PC room because I already invested a lot into it, but it's 99% grinding. I've answered every survey with ""please increase drop rates."" The recent characters are also super generic, making it similar to your typical waifu game. It's disappointing how they've lost the plot."
"Terrible. Game won't ever start. Initially downloaded 30g of updates, then did it again. After almost an hour of waiting, I gave up and un-installed it."
"I would never recommend a single hoyo game and genshin by far is the worst one -lack of quality of life features despite nearly being 5 years old -extreme lack of variety to the point that an entire nation based on African and indigenous cultures features an entire cast of very pale skin characters -Although there's no pvp(player vs player), the game still manages to be more pay to win than free to win. It barely offers players any rewards at all do not download this dried up racist game"
"Quit the game due to lack of male characters, game seemingly transitioning into clickbaity waifu money farming game, sexualization of characters have gotten worse, storyline going from good to bad, then worse. Lack of events making the game dry, MC turning into typical harem protagonist route. Won't be coming back unless they do something about it."
omg perfect üò≠üòç
I've played this game several times even tho I love the game I .....every time I move devices every time I change the platform I'm using ...I without fail start from square 1 I've never been able to keep any of the progress I've never used a different email so I don't know how they confuse me ...truly a difficult company to work with
The worst gacha game
just add controller support
love the art style and stuff but there is a moment when I can't open a chest. not because I'm not yet solve the puzzle but there is just so 'button' to claim the chest. is happened a few days ago and still I can't claim the chest. please fix this bug hoyo
good experience
natlan saved the story of genshin impact
No skip button
"Building characters super sucks. It takes the fun out of the game. And I don't really like the combat, it relies on elements too much. I want characters that feel that they're really fighting, instead of hey, I dropped this flower, it damages the enemies, and then this other character drops another thing that reacts with the other one. Like, dude, it doesn't feel like they're fighting. Make them hit enemies with their weapons, man."
crazy
best game everüî•
"STINGY GAME, DON'T WANT TO LISTEN TO WHAT THE PLAYER SAYS"
I just want to play this game on pc but I don't have pc
you already know what I am going to say üòâ
"No customer support or empathy or care, typical Chinese. I recommend playing free to play, paying is not worth it and they never give any real support. A bug in the game resulted in my loss of resources, I report it and they say there's nothing they can do about it and to ""be more careful"" as if to say it's not a bug. It is a bug and they won't even check the logs or help me so I'll never buy their Genesis crystals. they will never see a penny from me.I planned to this summer but no. Never."
best game ever
"Great game...one of the best game I have played till now. Still needs improvement like endgame content, permanent things to do, improvement in artifact RNG etc."
literally js became a gooner gameüò≠üôè
‚ô°‚ô°thank you for making this game‚ô° it really made me happy üòä
Best Single Player Adventure
GOOD STORY GAME
I love the lore that's all I care
cool
Love this game but they need to improve their portrayal of culturalgroups. The nations Natlan and Sumeru have a terrible problem with white washing the represented characters and reducing cultural influences in their designs compared to other regions. They need to improve their designs now and add darker skin characters with clearer cultural influences. SIGN THE SAG INTERIM AGREEMENT I WON'T PLAY THIS GAME WITH AI VOICES
"uninstalled the game for good; finally free from it's iron grip. the new characters are all boring & their designs look cluttered. i will never understand genshin's insistence on providing the bare minimum when it comes to gaming experience; uninspiring dialogues, overuse of blackscreens, reusing idle and fight animations during cutscenes/quest ;all this despite being a multi-billion dollar company. how shameful. Its only saving grace ended up being the music‚Äîthe one thing I could never hate."
"The version 5.5 world quests are incredible, and the qualities of life added definitely improve the experience! That said, the VA situation is starting to affect some travelers' enjoyment of the game. Oh, and we NEED playable Capitano!!!!!!"
it's disgusting what they're doing with this game it used to be amazing the way they're potraying characters now is simply off putting I'm not sure who the target audience is supposed to be but with the amount of people leaving genshin including me it can't have been a good choice. Literally I don't know how they managed to ruin one of the most popular games I hope they come to their senses for sneznaya..
nice game
"Let's be clear, the only good thing about genshin is it's characters. In order to get to the good parts of the story you have to get through a LOT of random npcs who aren't even helping the main narrative. The game barely has any combat after you reach endgame. You'll be stuck grinding the same stuff over and over. This hasn't changed in 3 years. The game barely rewards players in comparison to other gacha games. This game is for little children who don't care what the game gives them."
nice game
fanservice elit dengar player sulit
Do you guys dont listen to player at all? imagine talking scene on the event and the game crash even if i try again it keep crashing but gameplay just fine but talking scene not. The hell is wrong with the game just add a fricking skip button this game the worst event and the last time this happend too i though thats was gonna the last yet here it come it happend again its like the dev didnt do anything about rhis crashing i think its time to drop this game
"nice game, sigewinne is my daughter"
pretty bad game ngl
Badiya game he
"Love the game, really. What it lacks from the start would be the compatibility for controllers on android. I play in PC and lately struggle to play touch screen navigations. I've gotten used to buttons, and I'm very comfortable with my choice of device. It's just a bummer that when I want to play with my phone or tablet, I'd rather get tired or feel uncomfortable and not enjoy the game without any buttons. Please take this to consideration. 5.5 update: Thank you for bringing control support!"
"I love thus game more than I thought it was the best game ever!!! The characters, the lore and everythingthank you mihoyo edited: NVM this game started very very good until natlan came. everything changed it's just getting worse and worse , as a Chinese player the white wash....just weird and the sexualise makes it worse- I quit I wish I could return my money"
it's a great game overall
"quality of life locked behind paywalls. Could have been a great game, oh well."
"The whole Natlan's arc, ranging from the world building, the story quests, and the characters design; It's quite a miss for me. It doesn't give me the idea that Natlan is inspired by countries in Africa or South America. it's just more of a Madmax Universe. I really don't have high expectations for the upcoming Nod-Krai. And also, there's literally 0 lore or stories that relate to the MC. We don't know if he and his sibling just really travelled and explored world. We never know the reason."
quien creo este juego pa detonarlo me dejo con ludopatia y ataques de ansiendad (perdi el 50/50 de neuvilette con jean)
breath taking views and scenery. awesome cutscenes but after a view weeks it just becomes a gambling machine.
"Genshin Impact continues to impress with deep lore, breathtaking music, and a massive world to explore. The balance between challenge and relaxation makes it perfect for both casual and dedicated players. Natlan feels rushed and out of place compared to earlier updates. Still, the game‚Äôs world-building, character depth, and ongoing updates make it one of the best RPGs out there!"
I used to love it and play every day but now it got boring.
best game ever I love playing it
thank you for Android controller support
üëå
To put it simple The game is good. The fandom isn't
this cool and fun for me so relaxing and i give 3 Star because of the game sometimes lagging but it still fun fir the grafik cool
"The new exploration in Natlan is amazing, but I'm tired of nameless female characters being prioritized over the male counterparts that have been announced months ago. On top of that Natlan's story is a downgrade compared to Fontaine, and the Natlan character designs are all over the place. Let's just move on to Snezhnaya already I'm begging ü§≤"
"I like this game, Really does this game make us happy?"
its cool but lets not forget its the creator of all predatory gacha games
good game
"Genshin was one of my favorite games during 2020-2023 with all the fun events and amazing atmosphere. But since 2024-2025, it started to get boring with the events and it was just a repeated cycle of, logging in, doing your daily commissions and quests, logging out. Fontaine was very enjoyable and set high expectations but when Natlan came in, there was a lot of controversy and fan-service."
"Absolute dogshit game. Same repetitive mechanics, no skip button to skip all that yap. It's better to just download a wish simulator"
Instead of protecting your voice actors you just decided to replace them?
"Ever since the release of Natlan, the characters have been more and more powerful compared to those released in the previous regions, while their designs have been having more and more dissonance to the pre established setting. Additionally, the rate of male characters has drastically dropped, especially for those of higher rarities (one 5* male has been released in almost a year at the time of writing), and the designs of female characters has been getting more ""fanservice-y"""
Hu Tao is the best character ever created by humanity. The game without Hu Tao is mid.
JUST GOATED LIKE LITERALLY
"It was fun playing it, it has many adventures to go!"
at first was really fun but now it's meh
it would better if we can play along with our friends too playing solo is not fun at all .....
I am a big fan I wish to play genshin impact for 2023 to now but it took a lot long to load in..that i give up on it but then a again i always download it and try to paly it but fail..üò≠üò≠
It's a beautiful game.
The events and end game are fine. It's just recently it is focusing on specific audiences and the main story isn't as fun as before. They also never listened to fans feedback too. pls do better
2 stars because maybe this won't be mass deleted like the 1 stars
I've been playing it for like 4 years now the main reason being the story but lately I've become trouble with it's poor artifact drop rates and upgrades I've been farming for months and other drawback being unable to use my old dps characters in abyss cuz new abyss just focuses on bosses and mechanism requiring latest characters besides from that the plus points would be amazing story good graphics good open world experience and combat mechanics
"game has fallen from grace for me, story wise, quality wise, with dubious marketing moves, upholding announced reward after popular banners, very stingy amount of reward every patch.."
At first my rating was 5 star but now I feel like the game mechanics are repetitive
The fandom of this game is so toxic and the game is so cheap in rewards...
"I will start with this: I adore this game. I played it for the characters, their personalities and their lore. I got to fall in love with the world of Teyvat. I went up from start to AR 52 within 3 months. I play for the characters. as an artist, they inspire me. I cannot support a game that will get rid of voice actors, REAL people, because they don't want to be impersonated by AI. the Eng VAs love this game and WANT to work, WITH protections for their jobs. Sign the interim and I'll return!"
"Please add a skip button to the story, at least just for all side story"
Good open world game
it's good if you have good phone
god give
The developers were never interested in listening to the player base and improving the game. look how much money they make on each new banner. They don't need to. that's why I stopped playing. Wuthering Waves blows genshin out of the water
"got the most revenue of them all, but can't even put any effort implementing what players want, making updates no one asked and locking up QoL on limited character, shame on you"
Very nice and good game. It is very exiting and fun game

I love the game. Its such such vibe! How genshin feels after killing the MC's side character friends:üòú
This game is amazing. It has great graphics and great stories and fun characters to play with. Its really shocking that jts only for free and has no ads for me and people can join other people's worlds which is a fun experience. The story/lore is very fun and has many quests to do to get a lot of rewards. This game however got backlash due to the anniversary events but the game still gives lots of rewards and is still beginning to give more rewards from the anniversary and upcoming events. üòä
fell off. never listen to players.
very good
"good, better than hsr"
good game
what the hell is this game...quests are like talking to fruits and vegetables all day....
awesome game
developer lu dengerin saran player kaga si??? percuma lu survey tiap patch.
good üëç
I LIKE THIS GAME BECAUSE GRAPHIC AND STORY IS UNBELIEVABLE üòÑ
"starting to love this game again I love the character designs,story,map etc but of course there's still things that could be added to improve the game"
"All aspects of the game is pretty good, as expected from Hoyoverse. But some culture things just isn't right, and Natlan kinda disappointed me"
at first I absolutely loved this game! the story is good and the graphics were beautiful but there's way too much grinding required and I don't have the time for that. the biggest reason why I gave this 2 Stars is because I KID YOU NOT THIS APP TOOK OVER 45 MINUTES TO LOAD the amount of space it takes up is INSANE and honestly just not worth it
cant turn on control support in settings
I've played for many years... it's so hard to say now but I'm severely disappointed. There's so many issues that get covered over by cutsie aesthetics just so they can stab you in the back later. I am too tired to list them.... I enjoyed the game for a while but I can't say I do now.
"The game itself is fun.. somewhat. The lack of Voice Actors makes it insufferable. instead of guaranteeing safety from AI, you replace them. Other than that and the fan service, it's okay. Most of the playstyles are enjoyable, and some of the designs are amazing. + Most events are cool. Although it can get sorta boring and repetitive.. and some events are mainly for only one singular character that not everyone has.. (Hint hint.. Mavuika) It's fun when you only just started getting into it ü§∑‚Äç"
underpays voice actors
best game ever ^~^
I love this game but I hate their demon names
yeh game bahot accha hai but isme sabse badi problem travel ka hai bike or koi gadi hoti to yeh game bahot accha hota but yeh game sach main bahot accha hai
The dev team never listened to the player's feedback. Lazy and greedy and worst of all doesn't even want to sign protection against AI for the VAs
Love hate relationship fr
bad character design. I'm disappointed with natlan
I love that
"download is very slowly and I have a problem, the download is slow, where by half an hour it reaches 5%, and then if the loading stops a little bit and I go into the game to play the download, I find that it goes back to 0, that is, I can never get into the game, even though I have 73gb space."
peak
"While I enjoy the game overall, the lack of actual diversity in the playable characters is incredibly disappointing. 1* Rating due to the horrid treatment of Eng VAs just trying to secure their rights. Recasting voice actors instead of respecting them as people isn't a good look if you ask me. I'd rather have a completely silent game than AI or scabs."
best game ever üòÑ
It's really nice but why do the new characters have to be sexualized? Too much skin is shown.
"not ""f2ps"" defending this tho, really if only you lot knew the pain and hardwork the players do, mostly whales and those who pay for the game. at least a little appreciation will do, not to mention the fact that mhyo only care about the cn players and doesnt even take notice of the players outside cn is really downright disappointing. probably bcs ur just ""f2ps"" thats y y'all dont care but man, try spending on the game first then come back for a proper review dumbasses"
"Billion dollar company refuses to be transparent and listen to players, still has no Artifact loadouts despite being the top requested feature, New region has been all over the place in terms of design and themes. little diversity in playable skintones despite the cultures they're ""borrowing"" from and They recast one of my favourite new character's voice for no reason, refuse to offer protection, ensure consent and proper compensation for AI voice training off their Voice actor's work."
I got gambling
Has controller support on every version but Android. I played in 2020 but fell off because that reason and the lack of that feature has finally dropped my review from 5* to 1*
my best and first gacha game
"The magic is gone. Once upon a time, booting up Genshin would cue responses of ""wow, that's a mobile game?"" But beautiful character design and pretty graphics can't distract you from the glaring faults in the game forever. Fans praise the story, but I'm convinced that they're actually praising the lore. The storytelling itself is a slow, bloated, tedious mess worse than any MMORPG ever was. You spend hours and hours clicking through meaningless dialogue to get to the good stuff for a few minutes"
replace English VAs
"The game is turning into incel bait slop, the story doesn't make sense anymore, the character designs are catered to gooners and the most recent region, Natlan, has had the worst designs and story Genshin has ever provided. Not only has the quality dropped immensely, they now only cater to male fans who demand fanservice at all times, suddenly all new girls like the traveler and are ripped of their own personality. Uninstalled the game, happy to never play again."
amazing game but later in the game it's much more of a chore than a game. you can still enjoy it though you've just gotta be creative.
really cant pay their voice actors and promise to not use ai. first the english voice lines were missing and now they're replacing beloved voice actors.
extremly predatory gacha system and very long wait time for updates
not fun and unpleasant to play.
used to be my fav game but it's heavily falling behind. it feels like this game is living in 2020 and not evolving like other games are. sad. i hope the devs ACTUALLY improve it so that it can be a great game again.
"doesn't like their players, doesn't listen to them either"
it's my least fav hoyo game but it's still good I mainly play for furina and it's a bit late to quit considering this is my 3rd year playing
natlan flops üíÄ
recasting while a voice actor is on strike to protect their voice against ai.
"Simply a phenomenal game. It's storytelling, pacing, characters, cultures and regions are very high quality, with a lot of fun put into them. Fast for the gameplay, it varies dramatically depending on the team you use as you mix different weapon types and combinations of various elements, where there are seven total, there are multiple powerful or useful combinations. Anybody who rated this anything lower than a 4/5, simply does not have good taste."
I love genshin impact but i think we players deserves more ....
the best
nahh
"good game, tho lower the GB, it is an insane amount-"
I just don't like this game combat feels stiff the story is nice though
"got hacked, account retrieved but lost all my artifacts, nice game!"
"boring story, boring event, boring character designs, less male characters. if you want my money, make more male characters."
this game is best but I hate loading beacous so slow and late
Nothin to say anymore.....
simply just mid. wuwa better dont bother playing this very f2p unfriendly.
"Genshin Impact is a cashcow game. I feel like Hoyoverse doesn't care about this game, there are so many outdated features in this game that need clear reworking, these issues have been brought up by the community so many times but Hoyo refuses to listen to us. They keep adding tini ""QoL"" updates that nobody asked for. Genshin needs a huge rework from a resin storage system to an updated banner system to so many other things."
"The game is great but the fan service is getting annoying. You guys want to make more money? Give us more male characters, and ones that don't obviously copy other characters that you don't own. Also, I choose to be f2p because I refuse to give any money to people who are trying to use AI in the future. I'd rather play this game with no voice lines at all instead of playing with AI. Stop ruining this game with every new update. You're downgrading at this point"
best game
Seriously disappointing stuff recently. Do better.
"Natlan made this game one of the worst. Almost no new male characters, just cringy uwu or badass big badonkers women. Bruh."
"after fontaine, everything went downhill.. i personally love genshin impact but seeing what it has became now makes me lose interest in the game.. it's disappointing but this is only my opinion.. keep improving hoyoverse :)"
yay
"the two stars are because of one thing. some quests. yes, I know, but you'll understand once I start. for some of the quest. ex. the one I'm on rn. aka to the skyroad. sure it's annoying in its own way. but the part that REALLY grinds Mt gears is the fact that I can't join co-op UNTIL I finish it. I'm stuck on it because I have to glide to an island in the sky. BUT I'm having trouble with it. HOYO, LET US PLAY CO-OP DURIMG QUESTS PLEASEEEE"
"Tbh... I play this game for fun, this why I rated it as 5* in the past... But this patch... This patch made me drop my rating to 1*... I spent a super rare item in the game, 6 of them! Sanctifying elixir, supposed to be one of the best artifact hunter after this patch. And ONLY 2 rolls landed into crits, which was the 2 guaranteed!!! This is a joke! If I had known the update was that bad, I would've tried my luck months ago and gotten the same result! I'm done spending on this game, good luck"
"The game is just sloppy with its story recently and the character designs are just illogical and even more centered towards fan service to the point where it just ruins them for me. The game, that I used to be obsessed with, is sadly no longer interesting and up to par with what it once was."
love it just started a day ago and love the game so additional and still trying to figure out how to find players to play with on her
"Good game, but the fan service and the change of the game is getting too much though I'll still play for a little but I've been playing wuthering waves more and other gacha games"
the game is hacked it won't let me do this one quest now I can't Co-op with my friends I'm suing
"The fall off HAS to be studied. I actually started playing right around the time it came out and then took a break for a couple of months. After that I consistently played for 2-3 years. I honestly used to love it, especially the character designs and lore. I will always remember staying up at night and playing this for hours. I quit, because the fanservice got to the point, where I couldn't ignore it anymore. It's disgusting, annoying and, honestly, bs. Don't play it. It's not worth it."
The English voices have been silent for MONTHS and your solution is to replace the VAs that REFUSE to work with you without protection from AI? Absolutely ABHORRENT but even abhorrent isn't even a disgusting enough word for what you are doing to your human talent. If you wanted to have a silent game there's plenty of quests in game that are unvoiced so don't even bother hiring anymore VAs if this is how you're going to treat them.
"Everything you heard is true. Great graphics, animation and music, deep combat and exploration, great enemy variety and (especially for a mobile game). These games get grinding, tedious, and repetitive as you progress, but gameplay variety and upgrade options minimises it, and you can enjoy it without paying or continous daily logins. The game came a long way from its release and constantly takes feedback and in 5 year, improving the game and adding new maps and features for free."
Trip ko lang mag rate one star
"A game that opened the door to a new gaming experience but got too comfortable on its throne. Attempts at sprucing up the game falls flat in comparison to other gacha games. They claim to listen to fan base yet ignore the quality of life changes players have been asking for since 2.0. Their decision to recast a striking voice actor was the straw that broke the camel's back, it is clewr now that this company and game do not care for the integrity and creativity of humans, they only care for money"
"Greedy company gave better rewards at launch then 1 year anniversary. With the current updates from Natlan, the game feels very out of place with characters whose themes don't make any sense and a new character who's clearly a poorly disguised fetish. Give us back the Fontaine designers they knew what they were doing."
dev never heard the player. i still love some character but for story and game now getting worst
Compatibility for new devices is getting worse and worse. Focusing on stability for new devices will be good.
"Beautiful open world with extremely limited ways to explore. Community suggestions have been ignored for years, and all they do is keep gating any fun you may have. Artifacts are the worst thing ever, grinding for months over single stats and expecting to receive 95% defense stats. No skip options for ridiculously long story lines, and you lose any of that progress if you're disconnected during playback. For a billion dollar game they are moon miles being Kuro in Wuthering Waves."
"Fire, your disgusting and down right unprofessional VAs for Paimon, Candace and Keqing. allowing them to keep their jobs after bullying the new Kinch VA is unacceptable. I'm done until they are gone!!!!!!"
This game is about having adventures in a fantasy world . This world is really beautiful and has various maps. The gameplay is good but it can be better. This game has a problem that is about being tight fisted about giving items and gifs.. Company doesn't care about its players . we don't have any fan services at all. New characters do not have good animations. We aren‚Äôt able to skip quests but the storyline is the positive side of the game.
wowie
no skip button
"it's time for me to quit this game. Natlan has been a disappointment, and now they've made a random character a 5 star while Iansan, who we've been waiting for for 5 years now, is a 4 star, and they're also recasting voice actors who are rightfully striking for protections they refuse to provide. I loved this game for 5 years, but it's time to leave. maybe I'll come back if it gets better."
when I open the game it closes and now I can't play I even deleted it and it didn't work I want a 10 pull
The first actual game I really enjoy playing and it's so fun. The only thing that's boring is to farm primogems. It's really difficult to farm them even after doing whole exploration it only gives nearly 4000 primogems.
best game everü•∞üî•üî•üî•‚ù§
super
I really enjoyed it üíôüíô
i lost my 50/50 I LOST MY 50/50 AGHHHHH
love the game furina is my queen like how you can work for items you want and get it very fun youtubers make very fun content
I'll be happy to return to 5‚òÜ if they bring back the previous va for Kinich and offer AI protections

the best game ever ever üíêüéâüåÉ
Yowww this game wiill be super fun .if and only if hoyo give us mmore event/primogem for F2P.
before 317mb after downloading 32k
Nice experience üòâ
Lately many players stop playing for a while cuz a many factors.. my opinions this game less of hype content and make it bored..
I had to wait 2 hours for it to not load and I'm too lazy to wait more also it takes all my storage üíî
"Been playing since the start and still my number one game to go to. Love the story quests, music, characters and look forward to every update that comes along. Perfect game to join friends also when not doing quests. Would recommend to everyone."
there is a bug in which EULA isn't naked
"Amazing and favourite game. Been playing since the beginning of 2022 and although have tried other games alongside nothing comes close to the stories, characters and detail within the open world. 5 stars without a doubt"
awesome
very bad rewards
the best game i ever played
My problem is with the version 5.5 first banner as it is fault and is clearly showing giving me 4 character only and and showing radiance to still give me jean . So the 50/50 pull for f2p is difficult to play as expected. Please hoyolab see my review.
voice note will opening is ruined by adding male voice.... please don't over do it..... I was getting emotional and connected but not any more.... pls remove this.
pls do something about that cup of commons quest it's not worked üò•üôèüôá‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
i love genshin impact
maybe one of the best game I have ever downloaded.
"great game, but the co-op is stifling. I can't actually do anything despite trying to play with my sister to make quests easier and strategize. Heck, we don't care that only the host gets benefits or is the only one making choices. We wanted to help each other grow and get to more places of the world, but we can't. I would have given it more stars, but I feel like this shows how disappointed I was."
super nice
I didn't have high expectations in terms of proformance or graphics. it does very well and is quite smooth. the graphics are good and depending on your setting the battery draw is very low. I played for hours and checked my battery usage and it was only using 6.2%. the story and dialogue flow nicely and consistently. they recently added controller support which drew me in. playing on a game pad reminds me of the psp. honestly I'm quite surprised how far I passed my expectations.
"Recent updates and game contents lack equal variety in gender and complexion, affecting both the storytelling & gameplay immersion. Exploration has become more restricting as players can't opt-out in an automatically triggered quest."
wow
best 5 star game to play if you want to increase your patience
I used to be so enamored with the game and loved everything about it. But now it just seems like a cash grab. The dialogue is too long and lacks expression. Exploration for 20 primos
"Okay,I love the update and all for now (I haven't done any) BUT i have a problem after this new update. i can log like usual the other day and then suddenly i cant??? like at all. i tried re-installing it and logging it again and again and guess what? nothing work. i still can't log into the game. yeah good,great. myabr its my device but mind you, i play it well still. BUT WHYYY,LEMME LOG INTO THE GAMEEE....! HOYO,WHAT !??? but still, this game is good, good,delicious ,yummy yum yum,"
"Honestly, I liked this game somewhat, but what bothered me is that the new updates do not add anything new except for new characters and areas without any new ideas. Another thing I was very annoyed by was the lack of a skip button to skip the story or some missions that I felt very tired in. I wished they would do this and add interactive things. Another thing is that there are some tasks that are impossible to find unless you search on YouTube, and you may need months to complete them all."
Again? are you being serious. other apps related to genshin when it request to update. in playstore and when you enter the game it will automatically be played but this game... I've never get stressed in my life on a game that when updated in playstore it will update again in the app and takes so long and no background download?? this is a addition to people's storage!
loving the game so far
very very good game
"chaska's surian tribe has a horrible control causing me to fail multiple challenge attempt , i wanted to have fun but got me want to stop playing instead"
best game ever
I love genshin so much
lose to mona ü´∂üèªü´∂üèªü´∂üèª
it's really my favorite game very much
"One of the worst combat system I ever witnessed in this type of game .... In sprint camera angle suck $ while fighting also combat system suck.... Whole game is ruined by .... 3 things ..... One from some of idiotic quest , second from combat system , third from combat itself .... üôÑüòí Everytime while fighting ping skyrocket, there is no skip or fast forward system ... I have to listen whole conversation.... Waste of time üôÑ."
I like the fact that most of the female characters (excluding children of course) are hot
"A fabulous storyline..it is a game specially made for anime lovers..its graphics, its textures are super awesome. It is probably the best game I've ever played"
this game is so hard to log literally takes for 30gb
jood jame
"The direction of Natlan just keeps proving the fears of long time veterans true. Powercreep and feature creep have finally made any previous whaling insignificant. Any investments made before 5.0 are worthless now. 5.0 is doubly worse for f2p as well. Overall, this game has become unenjoyable."
it's so very good game and experience and the story
"Lack Of QoL,not quite f2p, lip sync gave up, no voice lines for some quests, no quite lively, most QoL is locked behind characters. üëè"
I really love this game eventhough ive only started playing a few weeks ago. Though i just wish that you could have an option where you can use your keyboard tablet case even if it isnt through usb or through bluetooth since only my mouse has bluetooth.. But overall great.
top 1 anime game
"the latest QOL was bad, the story wasn't that good, and the gameplay is so slow because of the unskippable dialogue. It such a waste for game that look this good but the dev won't listen to player's critique regarding the glaring flaws of the game"
Guud gaem
I don't really have any problems with the game at all but I think that the rewards are way too less. Overall I love it. Also can you please update so that travelers can get their birthday cake 2-3 days after their birthday as well in case they forgot to login on the exact date?
"No Arabic language? Seriously, what game has remained without Arabic language until this moment?"
"This game is insane. So addicitve and just highkey fun. Lots of instresting stories and lore, not to mention the playstyle. If you have an amazing device your game will run smoother than clean skin! Overall, just an amazing game, including the characters."
5 star
CONTROLLER SUPPORT IS FINALLY ADDED! W HOYO! Though i hope Hope you add more optimization to the game
y'all had so much potential but y'all just flush it down the drain with your newer characters and why are we animating a stomach like this game became fetish content.
what the makapaka is this
good
really good exploring game. every single time when i thought that it's done and it shows me a new thing! such a relaxing vibe and building new characters is very cool
"This game is absolutely so good ! , It has many characters and is a open world game , we can explore things and Comeplete story quests which is fun !! and we can also Pull for characters and get some for free too. It is a very happy and fun game. Arlecchino is my most Favourite Character ‚ù§üòÑ"
best game I have I my life . graphics are just like heaven
"PLEASE REVAMP YOUR OLD CHARACTERS'S DESIGNS!!! And this one is kinda just personal opinion and preference but it would be cool to have more details in game like wind howling and everytime there's wind, the characters's clothes/capes will be blown away or flow along the blowing wind & npcs have different faces ('cause most of them look the same) and MORE EFFECTS ON CHARACTERS'S DESIGNS!!! Thank you."
"OUTSTANDING GAMES I PLAYED SO VERY NICE SCENERIES, PLOT OF THE STORIES, VERY VERY AWESOME GAME"
"Definitely worth trying üî•üî• , there is no better story game available for mobile better than genshin impact."
"The open-world exploration is great, but tedious and simplistic puzzles as well as the underground sections can make it feel like a slog. The story jumps between okay and terrible and is padded with irrelevant dialogue. Character designs are all over the place. The late game is almost entirely just upgrading characters, but terrible artifact RNG makes it feel like a waste of time. Events feel low-effort and their stories are frequently even worse than the main ones. And the devs ignore feedback."
wow what a great game 5star
Cutest
awesome
Please fix aiming shot probl em
Wow I see one guy actually uses uwu to avoids censor
"upgrade very very frequently, and each update is large. then before we can play, the game compiling shaders take a decade to finish. Bro, i just wanted to play it simple at my free time, but it was wasted to updating, waiting for compiling shaders..."
so laggy after updated to 5.5v.. server problems? please fix this problem
"It's a good game if you enjoy exploring and Zelda-like puzzles. Co-op is a poorly designed gimmick. The dialogue is boring due to MC being a puppet, and Paimon assumes the player has zero awareness of the plot. Therefore, the writing is largely shallow and boring. Excellent combat design that is muddied by a powercreep gacha monetization model. The characters are gorgeous, but expect to spend hundreds of USD (or hundreds of hours) to get your faves. I've been playing since version 1.0"
Best Game For Me üëçüëåüèª
i am so in love with this game Whatever the name of this game owner big thanks from me it's awesome üòé
Great game
good
ye you should also listen to your players.
Why there is only one 5 Star Male character in Natlan? And 1st tall anemo male is 4 stars. That's really frustrating.
super
wow it's Graphics is the best

Nice game... I ever play before üòâ
1 star because it took years to get your favorite characters in this game.
... I feel like the game isn't what it used to be anymore I would hop in Genshin ever day but now it feels weird to the point I don't even want to log in every day
"I've noticed that my review i gave yesterday got removed, so I came back to make one again. Add a skip button to quests, I don't want to sit through all day reading dialogs I don't care about."
"I like this game a lot but, it's not well optimized for my mobile at all :( I have a good mid range snapdragon phone , the game runs at 45 fps at medium graphics well but the game heats my device very fastly. I even tried putting all the options to the lowest and 24fps, but it still heats and consumes too much battery."
"I loved that game firstly, I've been playing since 3/2023 and really enjoyed the expirence but, I've just realized that this game is against Islam and its occasions, there is something called worship statue, there is a place called The Gate of Zualkarnaien, another one called: Wadi Al-Majuj,huh?? even some characters names are bad: Rahman, Gafoor, Yanabie, Nabyia and her cats are: Harut and Marut, what after that? I will stop playing until it is changed, and if it wasn't, I will Never play again"
please release some men I beg you.
"the best open world game! grafic of this game is great, it has too many characters, but 50/50 syestem is annoying cuz like u want raiden shogun but u get dilucüò≠ it happend to me actualy in raiden shogun banner and tht was not my first lose. and in questes characters just yap and there's no skip button"
give us free 10 pull login each patch and i will add a star
"one the the best Open world games with gacha system and beautiful character designs and Story. Explore the world map and witness the breathtaking view where ever you go. This is not a pay to win game and you can also play with your friends by entering each others world and have fun. And the most important thing is the game music‚ù§, its a Masterpeice."
"This game have most predictable story, graphics, character's, weapons, outfits and whole map. All over this game was too much üíñ love to play."
Getting worse
I gave 5 star
Great game
BOARING ZZZZZ
This game is soooo good I loved this game!!!
AR 60. played this game since inazuma release. It has been a great experience overall. My only disappointment is how some male characters are deliberately sidelined to have a female character shine. The blatan favoritism is obvious. Why market yourselves as a mixed game when you are making this game as a waifu bait?
good game üéÆ
"this game got so terrible as of late its so clear that hoyo is just too lazy and ignorant to listen to their community. the downfall of this game is heartbreaking. it had so much potential, but then hyv decided they dont care about the story anymore and they only care about wringing any penny they can out of the gooners and fetishizers that drop paychecks on this game. i seriously hope they realize their obvious mistakes, put on their thinking caps and actually put effort into their updates."
"best game, legendary game. but loading is too long ."
Used to love this game for 3 whole years but I was just blind to how badly this game actually treats it's players
Still have some bug
"The anniversary reward is really dissapointing :'( they could have made it better for the sake of the gamers who stay strong playing and enduring the game's insane ""RNG"" mechanics throughout the year. You could have done more MIHOYO. But yeahhh, game-wise, Genshin is top-notch, cant argue with it. update: never going back to genshin. wuthering waves is now my favoriteü•≥"
Please give more reward old characters getting useless need pull for new character
AMAZING
"at first the story is good but slowly it becomes bad and the most annoying thing is there is no skip button to skip 12h of complete cringe. this alone makes the game unplayable and company ignores to address this issue, it's a greedy company that doesn't want to improve its game rather they are killing themselves"
Very little improvement over all these years. Greedy and uninspired Devs.
the game is okay it's just when it gets new updates it takes up so much storage tbh
LOVE IT!! I ALSO LIKE XIAO! HE'S FINE AND COOL! ‚ù§
Generic waifu simulator. Don't recommend.
good a playable game
"just about the worst dev team in gaming. they dont do anything the fan base wants, even simple quality of life things. the rewards are by far the worst in all of gacha, and 90% of patches are filler. this is coming from a veteran player who has been playing since after a month of release."
"Playing this game for almost a year, I enjoyed many expects like VA, lore and exploration but now being at AR 57 there is nearly nothing left to do. My biggest dislike is grind for in game stuff, Artifacts grind is so horrible. Resin limit is so small that you need to grind for a month to get okay level up materials for one character. Biggest disappointment of all, recently Genshin devs has stopped listening to their community and made some Terrible decisions which saddens me."
"The story is bad. It barely has any stackes with all of the characters never facing any real consequences. None of the characters personalities really feel unique either, since barely any of them have any unique moral standpoint. Even the playable bad guys are just ""misunderstood good people"". The character story quests are horribly bland, since it's just a 2 hour unskippable ad. Combat feels good though. But it only got one update since launch because the devs dont care. Soundtrack is good too."
Controller support for android please
If you can handle Paimon's horrific VA there might be a good game under there.
good
"Please never improve this game, It's been perfect the way it is and it belongs to where it is right now.üóëÔ∏èüóëÔ∏èüóëÔ∏èüöÆüöÆ"
Thank you for adding a controller to this game and fixing some problems...from the launch of the first mobile version of the game until now thank you....hoyoverse.
love it
stupid game so slow
"Great game, amazing graphics and character lore I can't believe it's for free, has me hooked"
The game is good the loading screen takes forever im not a patience person and it takes so much storage..
remove paimon nonsense add skip give at least enough pulls to hit hard pity every patch stop adding qol which is locked behind 5 star characters stop stretching the whole version by adding filler patches add extra resin holder remove white loading screen.
"bisakah saya mendapatkan akun saya kembali? saya login menggunakan akun hoyovers selama 1 tahun. tapi, tiba-tiba akun tersebut hilang setelah update. akun GI : Namikaze (Asia)"

"the game is trash, waste your time on something else"

"game was amazing, but it's crazy how minecraft has more stars now then genshin üò≠üò≠üò≠"
"this is an awesome game, with great storyline! I love each characters burst and it feels so exciting to know that you get a 5 star but doesn't know if you lost or won ur 50 50. The natlan characters designs and overall, was disappointing compared to Fontaine, very disappointing. The characters designs are all... not as well made. (Like Varesa)"
listen to the fan base.
"Filthy company, filthy game. The company panders to the worst kinds of niche audiences. What little quality their story had is gone. Some of the best characters were ruined by fujo bait. If you appreciate good male characters - avoid this game at all costs. Disgusting. Don't waste your time if you want anything of quality. You will only get useless filler events in place of actual story and black screens with text in place of animations. Now with powercreep too. Don't give these devs your money."
I love it but on PC it looks better on PC but on mobile it does but still look great I just want too say that
Update: phone gets so hot it DCs from wifi when playing. Only happens with Genshin and no other app. My phone is pretty new and good specs too. Update 2: they have started recasting characters despite how much gd money hoyo makes instead of setting up interim contracts with the voice cast who are seeking protection from their voice being used to train AI that the tech industry wants to replace professional voice actors with. it's despicable and greedy.
"If the game could just stop disconnecting when u leave for the tiniest bit it would be amazing, other than that actually great game :)"
good game
Faltan personajes masculinos
characters designs where wasted on this game cause the game itself sucks
i love this game so much cuz i don't lose any 50/50
Natland is a mess
midshin ü§°ü§°ü§°
The greediest devs of a game I have ever seen.
"great but recently i lost my main account and I can't get it back i dont know the problem but when i try to hop in it, it logs me into a new account i really need help and i have proves of the ownership"
"As of writing this the game is improving in multiple aspects and it seems as if hoyo is actually listening to the player base in some aspects. I personally love the game, but I do often get bored and go long whiles without playing. It's a game that you can enjoy and hate for various reasons so if your on the fence about getting it, either do a small test run or if the download time is too much, watch a few reviews positive and negative. This game is not for everyone but for me its enjoyable."
"the miss treatment of VAs couple with stuff being bland made me leave this game, it's a shame because it truly was fun. sucks when companies get a big head and think they can do whatever they want. doubt ill be returning to anything in this companies span"
Updated review. The drop rates are atrocious. Even on brand new 4 stars they want people to get. I've finished the entire new area and quests without managing to see one copy of the new 4 star. The new 5 star character is also fetish/gooner bait for a game that is styled to look like a kids game. I would say the company could do better but they clearly can't since after 4 years android has just now received controller support. They've also removed something more helpful and made it worse.
"months and months, still no new 5* male in natlan patch. kinich is so done carrying the whole natlan."
"One of the best mobile games available. It has all the features of a classic RPG; quests, varied movement (like climbing trees), combat ease, action, adventure, story, looting, crafting, etc. There are, however, certain drawbacks. You're limited to playing as one of two preset characters (a boy or a girl), at times, the open world is so vast it feels overwhelming and you might get lost in what to do or where to go. Game loading time is extensively long. But, overall, it's a fantastic game."
natlan.
"Overall a fun game with a lot of content. On the long run it does get a bit repetitive. Desperatly needs a functionality to skip dialogues, controller support (like on PC) and Android auto-fill support for the login form. Don't understand why it keeps logging me out when I don't play for a little while. The huge (~9GB) updates sometimes prevent me from playing; downloading, verifying, compiling...."
tried to play on ipad never got passed the loading screen
is thare even a dev
its just bad
It's not letting me go past the down load screen and it says that I have to get rid of stuff (which I did) and its still not letting me please fix this.
I've been playing the game for five months and the only issues i found is the lack of content and the replay value after finishing the story and world quests.
very good
great game
"Now its just a big waste of time, extra star tho for the good past memories"
Would only be better if artifact farming was better
this game needs more male characters üò≠üò≠
ÿπÿßŸÑ€å
"mid update, no skip button and gate keeping exploration features"
"the game its self, like storyies exploration, and character farming/build is fun and awedome saucceeee, and the graphics are insane once your on a high quality standing station or device but makes sense, but yea its a wonderful game and still worth my time to play:3"
Recasting Eng VA (with no warning to original VA) who are striking for AI protections of their own voices made me quit.
love it also... change Kinich Introverted voice back literally everyone says he is extroverted nowwww
Bro this game is making my phone exploding
"The game only felt amazing for new players bcs they have lots to do (quests & exploration). Once you've done everything, you can blatantly feel how petty the game is. Even if you're logging in everyday and a try-hard player who completed every endgames, not every patch update worth of primogems guarantee a 5 star."
"Please why I'm stuck on loading screen 5.2,,, like is it a bug or whatüôèüôè"

"I really loved the game until natlan dropped. Literally they had the best setup possible, as there were no natlan npc in the entire world, so they could do absolutely anything they wanted. But no, lets completely change the aesthetic of the game, make characters which are like literally so oversexualized that most people cannot look at them :D Like seriously, I dont really mind paying money to have a pleasant gameplay. But natlan makes me actually be ashamed of ever spending a single dollar here"
Everything has been going down hill since the natlan arc and worsening with each update. The balance of male and female characters are horrible and favoring more to fan service thirst traps.
masterpiece
"This game is amazing. I will recommend this game and don't pay attention to negative haters, they are just lost 50/50 or they don't know how to play the game."
The game that made me addicted to games. Genshin has lots of memorable moments to me and it will always remain as my favorite and number 1 game.
"You've killed any spark your game had. The creativity isn't there anymore. It's gone bland. Hoyo may make good concepts, but implement them so terribly every time that it always backfires. It's even worse now that they plan on using AI."
this anime world is very good I like the way they put the game story and art together
this game neeeedsss to lock in the next few updates or genshin is going to lose a loott of players and money.
"it was so good around 3 or 2 years ago..I stopped playing for awhile and now the new characters aren't itü§¶‚Äç‚ôÄÔ∏è just my opinion, game is still fun but new characters are a nope"
Predatory
awesome.
my everything
I coudn't enter the domains it keeps crashing my game even though i have a stable and sturdy phone. And my internet is also strong and I even tried to verify the files but nothing worked! please fix this...
please just add a bloody skip button on dialogue.a lot of the players like me know the story by heart.we really would prefer to skip through and just play the game for the experience.

"I love this game but I'm about to delete it. It's gotten to the point that the game crashes as soon as it loads and makes it past the loading screen. If I'm lucky and it does play, it's lagging and slow to catch up unless you stand completely still for 5 minutes, even then the problem isn't solved. If you're lucky enough to continue playing it through the lag then as soon as you enter combat it crashes. It's a fun game but I spend more time waiting than playing."
"dont use ai for voice actors, rehire them and ill redownload game"
I love it though I wish they gave more primogems.
ŸÑŸäÿ¥ÿ¥ÿ¥ÿ¥ÿ¥ÿ¥
it's good but losing the 50/50 is very harsh and it is hard to get the materials to level my characters up
"I will be blunt. I extremely loved the plot, especially Fontaine and sumeru and in general, i loved the animation and the diversity in artstyles, also the music and scenery. however!!! the amount of storage needed to function at the minimum is ridiculous for a mobile phone, new players can't access old events that occurred long ago like windblume and I believe that, although I understand its not that simple, that the vas should be appreciated more, they deserve more with their role in the game."
pls make the events less character oriented and whale
Needs to listen to their community a lot more ...

"Such a nice and enjoying game, the only bad thing about it is the memory, it takes 30gb ! I think my phone with 64gb won't be able to handle it in the future..."
"The game is amazing, super fun but there's one problem, my co op mode and my tea-pot aren't working, I tried everything and finished all my archon quests but nothing worked, please fix that for me because I really love co op mode so please please fix it for me"
"I love the story, the gameplay, and all the characters and the design and graphics too. - UPDATE: 27.03 I don't enjoy playing it anymore... I find the weapon wishing system so unfair. it doesn't carry the guarantee to the enxt banner. I've been losing my wishes on weapon banner for 6 consecutive banners. I'm losing interest I just play because I still want to know the story, but as time goes by... I feel sad that I feel this way. ü•∫"
"I would have given it five stars, totally, and I absolutely love the playstyle and characters of the game, but I not so recently pulled my boy Kinich, and, apparently, his va is getting replaced?? The new va sounds like a depressed human being that has been constipated for thousands and thousands of years, with no home or place to live. whom has been eating old people that die in the streets. you felt bad for him, didn't you? You pitied him because he found out he was an aid-infested autism."
very similar to Overwatch where the only thing keeping it alive are the people who spent too much money/time to quit and the r34
best game I ever played just install if you have good pkone.
"Its great, I love it , but when you need to update into the game it takes hours.It takes so long I have to put my phone on a charger or else my phone will die. It would be do great if the loading could be faster."
I like it

"Newbie bias doesn't affect me anymore. Here's what you gotta know: although it's an okay game F2P friendly wise, they don't care a lot about the player feedback. While the fanservice doesn't bother me, what bothers me is they have almost no respect for the players, chinese or global. For a while there was a chinese bias, but not even that anymore. The story and gameplay, however, are still a 10/10 for me! It's a pretty easy game. Also, beware of the fandom, they kinda weird.. love the memes tho"
5.5 map expansion looks fantastic but still no way to skip dialogue and cinematics.
Best game ever
the best game ever
mixed feelings...?
got furina nice game
its a amazing game if u like exploring and gatcha it's a must play!!
"This game is a gem! The story is compelling, and the art style is gorgeous. The game's challenging mechanisms are wonderfully engaging, and the voice acting is top-notch. However, a few improvements would elevate the experience: a night mode would be much appreciated, especially considering the bright opening screen. Some story explanations could also be streamlined, and perhaps an increase in daily resins (if applicable) could enhance the pacing. Despite these minor issues, it's a must-play."
I was disappoint this genshin because storage 35090 GB. It's heavy. pls fix it.
nah
best game ever
Money milking game
Genshin could never
"Hey Genshin can you please add a skip dialogue button or perhaps a speed up dialogue button? I want to explore the open world, battle wild enemies, and solve puzzles, but the gameplay flow keeps grinding to a halt whenever any character stops to talk to you and it's REALLY annoying. Or maybe I should just go play Zelda instead because Nintendo actually knows how to integrate a quick and easy to understand story into an open world full of things for the player to enjoy."
well uh ew
Thankyou Mihoyo for adding controller support on mobileüò≠üò≠
"I adore the exploration and characters from the older versions, but the game's been going downhill since 4.7... As an artist who likes to design and write characters, the new natlan characters are terrible, with a lot of questionable design choices and great concepts with really poor execution."
nice
this game has a good performance and graphics
best game
FIX!! It takes forever to download! And update and do everything on it! I pay good money for this game and I am on the verge on deleting. HoYoverse please fix or lose your well paying customers. Yeah notice the s I will tell friends and family. And they pay more than me! All That I am asking is to fix. üôè I love this game okay!
Fun
Really sorry that I have to give a critical response since you guys only reply to them. I have a genshin account but my phone was stolen and I can't login to my previous Gmail so I am not able to retrieve my account. I have the remaining details you might require like uid or id-password. is there any way for me to retrieve my account ??? PLEASE REPLY üò≠üò≠

"Genshin Impact is a beautiful game and I love playing it everyday. But I have one problem. Genshin Impact doesn't accept controller or keyboard on Samsung mobile devices. I want to play with my controller but I cannot because of this. As far as I know based on research it does accept controllers and keyboards on Apple devices. Please also make it available for Samsung devices. Update:they apparently added controller option for Samsung now, I'm gonna try it"
Damot niyo sa primo
"Genshin is a wonderful and beautiful game, really. But lately it's fan service with characters and new maps are really going down the drain. Of course, that's just my opinion but overall, it's an ok experience."
It seems my previous review was removed unfairly. Game is stupidly contracted with Apple to limit the Android version for no reason. No controller support and no high refresh rate support.
nice üëç
good
"even though it needs a lot of gb, the story and lore are well written."
"Good gameplay, amazing graphics, immersive storyline (though sometimes too long), and great game, can be hard for f2p, but its possible"
I played this on PS4 and yes the power creep is differently unforgivable but when you know the strategies and how to make your characters at what you're supposed to do you have to I know the tricks of the trade this damn game does not tell you that you have to figure it out so if you really want to play this game do it on PS4 if u do this at the same time with that you will definitely reap the rewards!

"complain impact jirt, btw nilou cantik bnget ‚ù§"
pls atleast add mute button on update screen in the game...cmon hoyoverse
give a skip button to skin conversations and cute scenes coz they are too boring
honestly i love this game not too much fan service but in the end game we cant do much except just grinding for material
Why does Varesa In-game fighting voicelines feels stiff? It has no range. But her VA is talented enough and has a nice voice. Is this the voice direction? Please fix in update if possible :)
Very nice game...i like it..
fan service and gooner bait was not what players signed up for. as a day 1 player this game is disgusting and untouchable.
nice game
"the visuals of the pc version is amazing, but mobile version is not that good, needs improvement."
this game is amezing
I love this game. I love how I can explore throughout the vibrant open world map. Keep it up Hoyo.

"damn, 38 gb, are u sure that u has an optimisation???"
"After this update the game keeps crashing, it doesn't get past the initial hoyoverse logo loading screen. please fix this quickly devs"

I'm a 13 yr old girl who loves to play this game but the fan service is getting horrible! I understand Natlan a bit since it's a hot region? like Vanessa I love her but the SKIRT. And Mizuki has a lot of fan service. I can understand some for Natlan but why have sm fan service on others?maybe it's so the character sells more but idk, that's just me chat. I ü©∑ this game still ü©∑"
"The game has been brilliant ever since I started playing in version 1.0 .I have caught up the latest update and done the archon quest . Everything was magnificent .The anime , the story , combat everything was good . Now that I am AR 60 what I find that this game lags is that the rewards are too less for one who has achieved higher AR"
I love it and rip my storage... But can you at least put more black People that are not enemies... Especially don't make characters pale when where they live is hot
"boring, add skips button"
not letting me enter all the placess
very funsies but pls release more men
Put as much effort into making character and splash arts just like in hsr !!
enjoying the graphics ü´∂

"I love this game. I especially like the fontaine and natlan story quests a lot. Right now, I think that natlan is peak genshin, with its great story and amazing gameplay. I also love the indwelling, the new ququsaurus and the overall gameplay. I would recommend this"
Update is too big to install on my phone. I can't delete other apps that I use in daily life
this game is very fun it has so many characters in love how we fight bosses and level up characters and get materials
No idea why but im stuck on 5.0 phase 2 (kinich and raiden banners) when it should be on 5.1 phase 2 (hu tao and nahida banners). My pc has been on 5.1 phase 2 while my phone is stuck on 5.0 phase 2 (and I cant update)
Once in a lifetime experience
"Truly an amazing experience but in the long run, the gameplay feels repeatedly"
when i want to play the screen turn dark and my phone got frame and i hate to play it...
gooner and racist
"the chance to get the character you like Is very low , after natlan release it's not so much fun................... before I used to play 4-5 hours but now I barely play 10 minutes.................... give us at least 20 fates as gifts every banner........... we are not whale be can't spend money, I'm rich but my parents will not give................., to much less fun I don't know how to tell you , ....... make it more fun please üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠"
after saving over 60 pulls i got nothing in furina banner and my sis got it for at 47 pity 0stars
It's a bit annoying when it lag and when we have to update every time it takes a lot of space but the play style is amazing
"Update Review :- Thanks Hoyoverse make it happen. (It's very good if it supports joystick/gamepad for android, sometimes my hands are tired to hold smrtphone/tab while playing)."
"The game itself is Very very good ngl, the game offers variety of mechanics and learning them makes me wanna spend more time because the terain, maps, characters, everything is so good (Except the generosity) but of course as I spend time slowly get tired of everything, and I only log-in once every month to get the welcome back gifts, I think it's because there are many games that I should explore rather than this game but the events itself are kinda boring, I'm never convinced on grinding them"
GOOD
this my favourite game and also in future
Kadang nak jalan untuk farming char tapi malah sambung ke story tak jelas and panjang tak boleh skip atau klik cepat. Tolonglah la jangan buat auto story/quest secara tiba tiba. tak banyak masa nak fokus story.
best game
GI is life even if it slowly kill me from inside. my luck is so bad but combat system is just fun more combat events would make my rating 10/5
"Guess what, we are doing it again üòÇ"
"pretty good game but could we put it back when the characters and stories based on its game? getting less creative on some details like those npc exc for those playable charac?? at some point sense between female and male charac, like the bath scene? pls consider it, cus people would go round complain that this game becoming a bit sexlsng charac, it's typical js a game but yk theres people who would notice"
Just awsome
"I love the story, characters and everything ‚ú®"
thr best game I played
best game fr 4 years of playing now
"best game ever , can't understand how some people hate it even without trying it"
"game santai yang dimainkan tidak untuk berkompetisi dengan player lain, namun tetap bisa bermain dengan player lainnya. mostly dari gameplaynya udah cukup sempurna hanya bagaimana player memainkannya saja seperti apa. game ini ngga bisa dimainkan dengan terburu-buru, jadi harus bersabar menjalankan prosesnya."
well it's pretty good game but I'm still waiting venti banner and lose my 50/50
very wonderful game which I am very attached to
I don't understand why some people don't like this genshin is my life my entire bedroom is just genshin üò≠üò≠

"A pretty good, and relaxing game. But getting primogems is a pain to get if archon quest is done, and also getting new characters are also a pain. You have to buy wishes, and not get them (unless not max ar and unfinished archon quest). I recommend, that a Luxurious chest can give wishes (either the blue or the interwined wish). Oh and one last thing, Remarkable chests are a scam, if only gives you some blueprints. Atleast some materials. But overall.. This game deserves a 5 star rating."
"so far I am really enjoying it, I hope it's stayed this way till the end."
"I'm in love with this game I love it so much, but the thing that makes me sad that I don't have any five stars characters, I lose 50/50 every time but I'm still tryingüôèüèª"
"good. but it will be even better with more male playable characters. i'm so fed up with the constant release of female characters, they outnumbered the male playable characters especially tall male characters. hope hoyoverse listen. release more male playable characters. make tsaritsa a male for we're lacking a male archon. make Capitano, Pantalone, Dottore, the jester, and more snezhnayan as a tall male characters."
I want IFA 5 STAR! PLEASE!! üò≠

"Although it is a good game, it has a big problem, that is, it has limited languages. There are many dialogues in the game, for example, because there is no Persian language, we cannot understand the beauty of the words in the game and we reject the dialogues."

it takes so much time to load for the update üòï

"The game, overall, deserves 5 stars, yes. However, what annoys me most is how long it takes for an update to download. Five hours have passed and it's only at 5.36%. I have more than enough storage, so I can't say that's the problem. Network connection? Excellent. So I don't know what's going on, but yeah, that's my biggest issue, even though I really enjoy the game."
lowkey has stop playing because i no longer find it enjoyable to play like last time
it's a 100gb+ game on Google play games beta I've downloaded and game is not working üòÖ
ÿÆ€åŸÑ€å ÿÆŸàÿ®Ÿá
Its cool i liked it much
"great, but still need improvement, such as high storage download and lack of story ending also hard to farm for primogems"
It's good and easy to play
"Worst game ever!!!!!! Such a waste of time!! its sickening that after years of farming artifacts, all u get i poor stats. And whenever u get a good piece, it will then roll to the most garbage substat. Such a poor game!!! Not worthy of your time. All u get is garbage materials and sets."
This THE best game i have ever played. yes it has its flaws. but overall i really love it! i have been playing since June 6 2022 the characters arw beautiful! tge story is amazing. it just gets a bit boring sometimes but this will forever be my comfort game ‚ú®‚ù§Ô∏è
"It's a great game. Unique graphics, attractive stories, exciting gameplay, great character variety, friendly environment and different challenges in the map have added to the beauty of the game. If you have no internet problem, you can install this game, but if your internet volume is small, I do not recommend installing this game because it will give at least 3GB updates every 40 days. Also, after downloading this game from Google Play, you need to have about 30GB of internet volume to download"
..... It's good
Amazeballs game !! totes recommend
Really interesting lore and insanely fun gameplay but... the QoL features are insanely bad... like the resin for example. how is there not a resin reserve feature? Cause only 5 condensed resin is not sufficient enough and the gatcha mechanic is very... VERY unclear. this game from a gameplay standpoint is really good but it has a lot of scummy moves in the internal features which is a huge shame... do better hoyo your fans deserve better.
it is really amazing.
this is a very good game good graphics and also decent stories
best gacha ofc
This is the most amazing game I ever play but I can't play it anymore because now genshin impact doesn't work on my phone but I love this game so much I have so much fun and emotional experience playing this game if you like adventure and open world combat game you would love this you would get emotional attached with the beautiful character and stories are amazing I miss genshine and this the best game I ever played
–¥–æ–Ω–∞—Ç–Ω–∞—è –ø–æ–º–æ–π–∫–∞
this game is very nice but too pay to win as free to play player I find it very grindy just to get some primos but the lore and world building make up for it
"The graphic is soooo good! There are a lot of cool lookin characters! But there is a problem with the storage, but it's worth it! The story quest is awesome, it has Lores and its fun (I'm sorry if my english is bad)"
"i will give this a 5 star rating cause beautiful story,places and good characters"
its the best game i really love it.
I've been playing since 3.8 and I enjoy playing it so far I really enjoy the puzzles chara designs playstyle and everything but there are some issues too for example there is almost No male five stars in natlan except for kinich and that's a disappointment and too much fan service for female characters and the playstyle mavuika playstyle is sooo fun there's no doubt In that but a motorcycle?? that doesn't fit genshin's aesthetic AT ALL!
"I love Genshin more than any other games I've played till now, i used my time much more with Genshin everyday,,, but i wish i could buy a Mid-range smartphone which could handle this game much better to play ‚ñ∂Ô∏è I'm poor wish somebody donate me or else earn to buy a new phone üì±"
"This is a immersive open word game, which in my opinion is one of the best games out there. the graphics and gameplay are soo realistic. everything about this game is just mind blowing. (we need a way to get resin without waiting for 2 days or for a new event)"
nice
The best game i ever played

"Totally Awesome. The open world adventures and the story plus being able to play in multiplayer makes it more fantastic. Players have a lot of freedom in what to do in this game, such as to explore, follow the story, defeat bosses, and play with friends."
I have been playing this game since last 2 years and I am at ar 33 it is best game
Amazing game I play this game everyday
This game has an amazing story and character system but it lacks a good community.
Raiden rerun when?
"No proper end game content current one just hp inflated mob with character check at the end, lack of QoL changes which always take many patches, game is really good for it's genre but the devs are just taking the player base for granted and the surveys feel useless. Dawei may cry all over in livestreams, QoL changes implementation need fixing again as a another QoL change. Look at other games which are better, before playing this one."

Well I like it but you can fix something's like the resin collector or something so I can store my resin to use later on and keep the material domain permanent and the weekly boss get the item that is actually needed not the other one which is of no use it's a hassle to go through all domain and get that dream solvent item
Not bad but I don't see much of overall Story progress and Imaginarium theater is too hard for F2P I can't even reach Act8 even though i can 36* in abyss. Make it easier.
it's very good but need big storage
"Overall of my experience from early release, it was a good experience from venti to raiden story. It was fanstastic but lately it feels like the puzzle, is so much harder but the most i feel dissapointed is the character animation and gameplay. They dont give so much impact unlike the early characters from the 3 archons patch version but then again it was good experience."
bro storage is crazy
game is so epic tht it got me playing it everywhere as well as the awesome character with impressive elements my favorite is kinich
The story music game play characters are amazing People say that its fan service but when I look the fanserviced characters I DON‚ÄôT SEE ANYTHING people are just a weirdo. I really want genshin don‚Äôt stop after the cryo archon I really want to see more differents elements like the last Act in the cryo archon I want the cryo archon tell the traveller that‚Äôs there are more elements than just 7. I really hope this get added!
the greatest game I have ever played
good
I like this game for graphics and world
always loved this game
it's my love
its a good game but some time its very boaring. dialogs is too long
amazing gameplay experience üëæ
Mehhh game is flopping nothing new nothing interesting almost zero rewards üëé
I like :D
the only game I have on my phone. I love everything about this game despite some of things that I might find it annoying. The story is tip top I would say.
absolutely love this game.it is the best for me!
My favorite and amazing this is literally so fun! I have been playing for 2 years now!
It is so good it's like an anime game but the pull or wish it's like so hard to get five star
this is the best mobile (role play or open world what you say) game i have ever played ü´∂
I love this game so so much it's so fun but I am confused why people hating on this game the puzzle are hard but it's fun it's like when you failed you can redo it just like life lessons
good game over all
"Best game I've ever played tbh,there are so many things to do in it,but my favorite is to explore and discover the stories behind every place and people.I also like the characters design of the game especially furina and wanderer.I hope to get wanderer soon üòÅ."

"Hello and regards, How can I share my suggestions and opinions about the continuation of the game's storyline with you?"
"it was so fun to play,ü´∂üíï"
best game I have ever played like infinite THIS WAS B4 THE DRAMA NO STARS 4 THIS STUPID AHH COMPANY
I haven't showered since I played W game
over the years the quality has either stayed or gone worse i uninstalled and hope that in the future i can have a high quality game that i once had my main complaint would be the lack of QoL improvements they couldve implemented it like how they did with their other games but refuse to for some reason.
I love the game but you gotta admit your customer service sucks
"I have been asking for Gamepad support for Android since version 1.6 and finally got that, four years later. I actually didn't play this game since Mavuika patch in frustration. Hopefully this will makes me play again"

"I was excited to hear we finally have controller üéÆ support on Android... I was quickly disappointed when my standard xinput (ipega Bluetooth controller) was not recognized. which is a quick cheap controller available on Amazon. If Kuro Games on Wuthering waves supports them, I don't see why you don't. Especially when the same controller works on the PC version of Genshin. ü§îü´§"
"please rerun old characters ‚òπÔ∏è i'm so sick of losing on chronicled wish (i only lose once to xiao) but man, i wish i could spend my primos on the characters that i actually want..."
NICE!
good
"one of the day 1 players in this game. this used to be such an enjoyable game in the first few versions, but now it's been pretty clear that it's just a cash-grabbing, money hungry company. the amount of fan service (ESPECIALLY VARESA AND CITLALI) recently has been utterly insane. imagine catering to the disgusting thoughts of messed up people so that you can get more money?the only reason i don't give this game a one star is because of the nostalgia i get related to it."
best graphic and fantasy story.... well it's awesome to play with friends üëçüèª
it's so interesting game
"meh, been pretty boring"
Did you put expiration to login details in the dropdown menu? I want to login to my old account it says it expires...so i manually input it again..now it says too many requests.
Loving it. Still loving it
for my problem even though I have nothing in my storage it doesn't let me update the game
Gooner game for now on.

Can we claim furina in 2025?
it's awesome but they need to work on the fairness of the reward
best game i have ever played
"... I has no word to said, but I am sincerely said that this game a little boring after this 4 years. The company and its developer never hear to its player plea... I do not know how to said."
"Genshin impact este unul din cele mai faine jocuri lansate . Are plusuri si minusuri Plusuri : combat fun, story super interesant , caractere multe , waifu xD , Minusuri : din pacate in late game jocul devine foarte meh , practic nu exista endgame content . Devs nu prea is curiosi de playeri f2p de exemplu aniversariile unde am prim un 10 pull plus un pet xD. Well well well cu bune cu rele jocul asta ramane relevant datorita versiunilor noi ,mapelor si al caracterelor noi aparute . 7/10 for me."
"As a 5 years player of this game. I lost my interest. Recent updates feels like joke. No more 5 star male characters. I can't understand Natlan characters, most of them are too modern that they doesn't vibe on how the country supposed to be. There's no more interesting in the game anymore. Characters suddenly appears as 5 star even they don't even appear in Archon quest. Everything feels like a joke. I love genshin very much before but I don't feel like this now."
it's an amazing game. just too much on my device. wish they'd cut the storage somehow.

it's the best game I ever play in my tired life
"This game is very exciting! I have so much fun with exploring and doing the archon quest and hangout quests,it gives some insight of the characters. But I feel genshin should really give a skip button as some quests feel too tidous to do so.As well as they should really change the navigation system cause it could be confusing for new players. Lastly they should make farming for primos much more easier as it could be sometimes a chore for some players. Overall the game is pretty good üëç"
"Honestly as much as I hate the company, I can't hate the game. It's nostalgic to some extent and I can't bring myself to not love genshin as a game"
amazig storyline and plottwist
I have a Chromebook and I like this game so I wanted to download this game on it but after finally downlading the assets around 30-50% of compiling shaders it crashes every time I tried everything uninstalling large and useless apps and still no change I even tried spending hours searching for game boosters cleaners and nothing worked a was of time and please fix this
The tism kicked in and it's been well over 4 years and these silly little characters and world is still invading my brain
this game is so good i guess
üí©üí©üí©game
thanks for the controller support
it takes too long to load..maybe my problem...
Bestestt Game I ever played.. But the only thing that I don't like is.. collecting primos.. it's so hard lmao..
Natlan is the worst region
"This is the worst game of hoyo. why ?? We don't get primos easily like Star rail?? Some players work their asses off to get their favourite characters and waste their money, I love to play this, But I also hate it at the same time. Grow up hoyo, Or else you'll lose your sales in genshinüó£Ô∏è"
Android version now has Bluetooth controller support and I got it working with my GameSir G8 Galileo
"amazing art, lore, adventure and so many things to explore in short amazing game"
more capitano fanservice i beg
Absolutely amazing!!! the characters are lovely and the new character Varessa is a great addition showing different body types :)
one of the best games you can ever play
üíØ/10 i'm so obsessed with this game üíì
"I SWEAR TO GOD THIS GAME IS EPICCCC this is the best rpg game I have ever played. Genshin Impact is a beautiful open-world game with exciting combat, great characters, and a ton to explore. The graphics and music are stunning, and it's super fun to play‚Äîespecially for a free game. In addition, the characters designs are SO COOLLLLL AND CUTEEEEE can't wait till mulani's and arrlechino's rerun!"
best
shneznaya save us please
I really love this game
good game and fun good story l need more like that
"the story became trash, bad character after 5.0"
soGOOD TO PLAY VISUALS ARE IMPECABLE OVERALL JUST SUCH AN AMAZING GAME TO PLAY
make ifa five star
The Game's taking too much amount of space Even I delete past data files it makes me install them again....
"I should jump off a cliff or drunk drive after the CONTINUOUS hard pity and constant Rate Off losses, thanks a lot hoyo"
"The Game Good The storyline is also good. But i hate events involved with fighting, but since it's equal to another kind of event I don't have much to say. üòä"
Quite fun but the game is a bit laggy for mobile players tho
P mabar
game fell off too much greed not enough actual programming
very fun to play character are very good and more
My issue is finally resolved thank you nd I like the game too much that's why I m again giving this game 5 star
natlan is off theme why is nation of war have cute things. you killed capitano he was the only interesting character.
this game is a part of my heart
a very cool game
Very greedy and exploitative company
"It's good, but definitely not phone Friendly, It's starting to get really bad now, but everything else it's good, good gameplay, epic characters and awesome lore and story line, apart from the storage thing, it's pretty good"
"INI GUA UPDATE LAMA BNGET COK, INSTALING TRS, BER JAM2 INI PEA"
Good gaming experience and adventuring but I think there need to be an option for button position customize or size since I am playing in mobile. üòÑ

goooooooood
"the story is great but i can see how lazy the developer with every patch, and the QoL are very bad, we barely get anything good in the past of 5 years. would recommend this game to anyone who looking for casual open world game but i dont think i want to play this game anymore since there is another game who care about their player more like Wuthering waves. since they prioritize the player base more then actually monetizing their game. Genshin Impact are like the Abusive-ex in relationships."
I have a nice gameqq
Love TCG
"i technically hate Natlan, although I love mauvika I hate that nation. Also add more events. I also hate the new character, I don't like her gameplay surely other's also agree w me. Still my favorite game tho."
It is really good and fun but it is hard to get primogems overall I really recommend it :)
"Mana skip button,trash game,fix your server lol mumy ping always 600,not newbie friendly, controller not detected"
"so laggy, please do something about Android players too"
absolute cinema ‚úãüòºü§ö
"I'm raising my rating to one and a half stars since you finally added gamepad support. It only took 1639 days to grace us with it, something that should have been in the game from day one. It really reflects the respect you have for your user base."
I love this game
"Its suitable for multiple kind of players like lore player, players who only build characters, players who only explores and more. This game also have lots of deep meaning stories. At first I could be hard but moving forward gives you the momentum to play the game."
i liked it
"quite good scenery and character. i ve played since the genshin first time release. When start from 5.0 the event banner comes up, i always not get the event character (could be standard or out of event character), it looks like the gacha mechanic a bit different like before, so thats makes me stop playing over 3 months. when i try pulling in 5.5 banner, i dont get the event character, but another one. i feel like it doesnt worth for pulling or playing anymore"
this is garbage but i cant stop playing
"Outstanding stories, characters, games, and everything is soo cool"
Bring Capitano Back!!! Like seriously....
It was Breathtaking....Go try itü§≠
Zawg give us better rewards
this update is trash. new character is also trash. domain is same as always lots of def. and trash artifact's there is no reason to play domains any more when you always get def. trash. new story quest is also boring.
I LOVE this game. 100% recommended
Love itü´∞
game for me this best game 5 Star other just toxic
"got boring when natlan came out. I've been playing since 1.6, and played consistently until natlan."
"The new characters are cool, just that the gacha ruins everything."
"Soo good!!! It's so different from other games and really well made. The only problem would be the loading and download time, but otherwise, the game is top notch"
"I have no words, I just love it Edit: I changed my mind from when I first started. Genshin doesn't listen to its fanbase anymore, and when it does, it's only the weirdos. At this point its not even an rpg anymore, just a game made for creeps wanting to see more female assets because they haven't seen a single woman in their life. And when it comes to Natlan, don't get me started. Almost no playable males, so far only Kinich and soon Iansan, and a male people were looking forward to killed off."

Its bad its repetitive everyone is quitting
"Since the 5.0 Update I observed decrease in Graphics, I know you are balancing the graphics depending on device specs but give an OPTION to ignore it,because there are some ways to get more performance out of even small and slow CPUs, if U could do that many people like me could be satisfied"
"rewards could be better. overall, it's a very esthetic and enjoyable role-playing game. I like character designs, especially Fontaine characters. But to really get the thrill and beauty of the surroundings in the game, it's better to play with high-performance mobiles or PC."
"this game is home. just, please! we need more male characters!"

"the wishing system got me freaking out but still a 10/10 game, would recommend"
Love the seiyuu
My favourite game since 2023.
Idk what to say its just an amazing game
Neva gonna quit.
"fall in love at the first play,,"
"Great storyline and amazing soundtracks, but end-game and co-op is a bit lacking."
"I think the game is really good but there's something I want in this game and that's (taming beast) option. As we all know that the whole world of genshin impact is very impressive and many player like me wants to travel the world, and not just randomly teleport from one tower to another. So I think the developers should add the system of taming beast to explore more efficiently. You guys can add some limit to the mounted beast like ""The stamina of the beast should be same amount of the player"""
I love it so fun
Fun rpg I think crossplay is great and I think the world is fun to explore it's a easy begginer friendly gacha game. the problem is that there's rng baked so much into the system for no reason. This game needs artifact load outs. lots of qol story can be good for the archon quests and some story quests but they can get long and confusing.
"I love the lore especially. this game has supported my through my childhood. It's really sweet, you should definitely play it. And the game mechanics are also so cool as well!!"
"I love Genshin ever since it came out, I only started playing it a couple of months ago and it's going good so far. Thank you Hoyoverse for creating this game to be enjoyable so pls keep it up!"
60 pulls not a single 5 star character
amazing
i am playing this game from start good to see this game is still going
I love this game but not farming artifact
"The world is beautiful and animation too. But when I play it on mobile it becomes a heater.Well that the problem with mobile. Can't do anything about it üòÖ.So basically it's my favorite game so far. How much do you guys put in it anyway. Amazing game, story is also good and characters too. Listen to players devs"
Bagus bgt game nya!! WOI LAH JGN KASIH BINTANG 1 PLS!!!
It's amazing no ads and I'm addicted there is always something to do I'd really recommend this game to anyone!
2nd Best Game (Honkai Impact 3rd is first ofc)
Constant huge updates and a horrible gacha system that's heavily against f2p players.
Give us primogems.
"the best gatcha mobile game u can ever play , u can name wuwa , but no one can beat genshin lore and emotions.... even not any fan service games....but please hoyo... don't make genshin a fan service for money... again.. please üôè‚ú®"

one of the best games I have ever played
One of the best RPGs i've played so far.Wonderful storyline and Amazing Graphics. The reason i gave four stars is that because this game is too big for standard mobile phones. You should reduce the game size. Edit : You guys actually listened to the players and released a cloud version. Thanks a lot.

"The game became one of the predatory gacha games I have ever played (and yes, I know it's a gacha game) but the fact that the exploration in Natlan requires you to pull for certain characters to make the traversal remotely fun, is a disgrace. And by the way putting the rewards for the anniversary in the second phase of the patch, to put even more fomo on the players. Congrats Hoyo, scummy as always."
"This game has become really really sad and boring. nothing new everything is annoying and sucks, the gacha is really really bad and predatory..... The power creep is becoming a thing real fast.... Just go play Wuthering Waves or Zenless Zone Zero. This ain't worth it."
Now has controller support on Android.
low rewards in every part of the game this not fair you should think about it
best
"I love this game but I redeemed 3 codes, it was supposed to come in my account but when I opened the posts, there was nothing. This bug happened to me for 2 times and I want my gifts, I haven't get the last update's gift too due to that issue. Please fix it and give me my gifts and redeems."
"Despite existing for 5 years already, barely any meaningful changes have happened both in design and optimization, that in turn lead to competers such as wuthering waves to profit from what genshin impact lacks in. Not only have they not added an option to off and on constellations of characters, they barely listen to what their players say, this company only follows what it wants and not what the players truly want for 5 years. I have played this game since 2021 and quit."
Always gives the worst wish pulls in the game. Even purchasing isn't worth it.
bad

Best Game I've Ever Played. The best thing is the story and truly it is a good game for F2P. You can get upto 60 wishes normally in a new update
the games great but takes up unnecessary data
This game doesn't deserve 5 star. It deserves 6. Excluding the gacha function the games is fire!
Plunge on phone is Agony you have never felt before in other third person game. Period.
It keeps crashing every 5mins for no reason at all
Soo good

I love this game with my whole heart the plot is fairly slow in monstat and lyiue but once you get past that the game is truly amazing
"5.5 UPDATE STILL SUCK. ARTIFACT SYSTEM RIGGED. SANCTIFYING WASTED, RESINS USELESS. HOYO NEVER LISTENS. PLAY WUTHERING WAVES INSTEAD!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! I WASTED 4 YEARS FOR THIS DISAPPOINTING GAME."

One of the best games ever

"Need new skins, new 5 star male characters released more often and more furniture via events, bp or shop."
"For best experience, be a F2P player. This game becomes challenging and annoying. Not because of the game itself, but because of envy with other players who have characters that you don't have."
One of the best PlayStation game feel.
"This game is Amazing even though it crash many times (it's probably my phone's fault). The Characters are amazing the gacha is frustrating the stories is cool nice, overall it's amazingly good üëç"
character designs getting worse and worse. BRING BACK FONTAINE CHARACTER DESIGNERS
this game have lots of adventure
love the open game get to do what you want lots of different things to do but I wish it was easier to get characters

"They replaced a voice actor on strike, which guarantees that many players will never spend money on the game again."
when I first started playing like 2 months ago everything was so shocking I had never played a game this good everything from the characters the story the different regions the books the secret chests and achievements the little Easter eggs and by far my favorite character is nahida no questions asked and also don't go on genshin Twitter you will have a bad time there and that about sums it up

"The game is getting way too big for mobile, plus some of the main stories are not so good, plus some of the side quests are silly, and some of the stuff of genhin impact is getting annoying and too much characters."
The lore of this game's multiverse is remarkable and riveting. This game's story is a masterpiece; I cannot wait until Kh'aenriah arrives. |œâÔΩ•`)
jangan kikir yee
absolutely cinema
"Hoyo is unimaginably stingy. I was a fan and addict of this game. Everything was perfect, the graphics and music, even the way the characters played and how beautiful the world is, but why all this stinginess for the players of Gunshin?"
this is haven for thos who are bored of playing so many other games and surely you will feel relife too
I deleted every thing in my phone.. For this update.. And it wants more.
"Honestly, Genshin changed me as a person. I really love the characters, the humor, the open world exploration, the story, and the fact that we have such a diverse cast of characters to choose from. The only thing I'd really say isn't as good is the fact that four stars are harder to get than five stars, both because of the wait and the fact that there are three per half. My favorite game of all time."
üëç
"I was played this games consistently for 4 years. This games have beautiful graphic and wonderful original soundtrack. If you like an anime this games is suitable for you. You can just login doing daily mission, using all resin, then exit the games. I just hope the developer more generous to reward all the players."
trash
"Phenomenal, beautiful & entertaining gameplay with a fullfilling and many heartfelt storylines. This game will surely take you on a journey."
I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH OMGGGüò≠üò≠
I like this game

it's so good until the game stopped working for good and I reinstalled it five times now and still doesn't want to work. I'm sad. please help!!
I didn't have any words this game have deserving lots of love ‚ù§Ô∏è this is the best game i play in my whole life
"It's getting super laggy, not like before."
I just like furina

"No Capitano, no good review"
"the designs are incredible, the storyline is amazing too!"
Natlan has been the worst of this game. The character designs are jarring and break emersion. the story has been awful and poorly written.

I like this game
"the lore,the characters,the exploration are all out amazing and 100% recommend to people who likes explorations and deep stories/lores"
"it's a really good game especially if you like animem.But later on I find some of the archon quest annoying because of the very long voice lines and walking back and forth just to talk to a person, especially the sumeru quest.Its the most annoying archon quest so far with the most useless rewards."
not good rewards
"Very well developed game, recommended to play on PC. you'll have to play on lowest settings if you play on phone but if your using a good phone maybe not. this game is really fun you can go co-op and play with friends! You can explore as well, and do quests. or fight enemies and farm some materials! you can get the. characters you want but sometimes you don't. that's all!"
amazing game
very adictive
"Make the constellations toggleable. Please. We spend primos not on permanent Constellation. But for the right to use it at our own leisure. Remember the Unlimited Vishap challenge in Fontaine and the Samurai challenge in Inazuma? I want more. 1 challenge for every monster. Possibly in an easy access area. An unlimited combat against them. Please. This is really fun. Also, if there was an unlimited combat Spiral mode. That would be cool. Also, 4 stars are too hard to get."
It's amazing game. One of the best story game I ever seen. Good graphics and best action. Character and other things are good.
I feel every moment this game so good
"My fav game I love quests , puzzles , scenes, mostly beautiful places i love everything about this game"
"repetitivo e sem gra√ßa, mesmo q seja bonito e bem feito os cen√°rios, √© frustrante."
Game is great
Bloody fantastic storytelling
sucks
"Play Wuthering Waves instead. Seriously. 4.5 years later, we finally get controller support on Android. Maybe if we wait another 4 years, we'll get loadouts and maybe even fix the uneven camera sensitivity, or get Resin overflow... Endgame content is still severely lacking, even though there would be great potential if they brought back the domain creator. Genshin could be so much more if this greedy company would put the money they make towards the game. Multi-billion dollar company, people."
good
üíö
"it's really good But there's one proplem All the characters are new all of it ""Fan service"" Mavuika, Citlali, Varisa, Xilonen, Mizuki, Mulani,"
"awesome story game, graphics is ok for the mobile version but excellent quality in pc and console version."
I like the game but I find it hard to play on the mobile.
The graphics and design are wonderful it feels like playing in the Anime world but it will take more than 30 GB storage of your deviceü•≤
English voice???
Feels like a traditional open world game but with more content and is actually so fun
I have big case genish.why same quest again and again.i did all smeru forest quest .but now it all back again.all quest .
Giving 3 star because it has server issue my network is good but my ping always 230ms+.Fix this problem
grafix
Well I noticed that the rate is going down so Im going yo rate it a 5 star. Well plss Give us some more primogemmssss
"This game is really fun, I love running around and collecting ingredients or things I might need!!"
"this is hands down the best mobile game I've ever played. it's graphics are super cool and I love the story. the controls are easy and I love the fighting style. I've never actually liked anime but this game has definitely made an exception. but, unfortunately, it takes up so much space on my phone that I have to delete all of my games and apps. I know I could get like a storage card but I would rather not. other than the storage space, I would definitely recommend"
"Since i don't care about meta and my yoimiya got power creeped by many charas, i like this game a lot. I just love to explore and enjoy the lore, and not getting 36 stars or 100% imaginarium theater on visionary mode because i know that it'll take more time to build charas rather than getting 100% exploration in every region + learning the lore"
I liek this
"Changed my mind upon updates. The devs just dont care about player satisfaction. Quality of Life is so poor on this HoYo game. Game lost its fun, and they arent trying either for us"
the best
"I absolutely adore this game, the graphics are A++ and the story is intriguing in its own right! I literally play this game every day, it's an addiction at this point haha But seriously, the only danger of this game is that you'll develop a dependence on it... well, and it can make your phone pretty hot and drain battery. But, for a game this amazing, I think it's worth it. It takes a lot of space, so it's better played on a gaming PC. Just keep that in mind. Great job Hoyo!!"
"The best open world game with its free world and original design, character development story, the joy of playing with your friends in co-op mode, new friendships, and endless missions. As for general problems, I can only say one thing. The game is extremely good and addictive, but sometimes it gives tasks even for small things, which makes you spend a long time, but it is very good."
um bom jogo por√©m repetitivo de vez em quando
trash dev
stupidass game i lost 50/50 to keqing
super
I love this game because of the Story and as well as the design of characters... also this game is popular for good map experience in mobile devices. The exploration progress of this game is quite beautiful... Enjoy Playing genshin impact with high graphics
just add a skip ! time is gold
I'll give this 5 stars.Who cares? This is Genshin!!!
Got the worst acct security support will not help you when you cannot login due to security issue. They cannot share nor help to fix the issue. You are on your own.
One of the greatest games ever with amazing graphics and amazing image and sound and music and stories and everything is amazing
"good game, the only thing I don't like about this game is that they don't believe that you are the real owner of your account (hopefully they don't mess my account due to my lost google account linked to it) I hope it doesn't meet the same fate like what happened with the other game I played."
Mantap
this game is very good and great game all of time and this game play I am life time ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞üòòüòòüòòü•∞ü•∞üòòü•∞üòòü•∞üòòüòòüòòü•∞üòòüòòüòò
Just bring Kaveh and Alhaitham back bro
it's cool
"good gameplay, very detailed and really cool characters. when updates take in however it is a long process."
best open world gacha game right now
It's a great game! Beautiful characters! Attractive adventures! it deserve all my moneyüòÇ‚ù§Ô∏è
Give me Xilonen's weapon
"been playing this game for 3 years now and all I can say is I am disappointed how it turned out especially after Natlan, the character design is inappropriate, the events aren't as fun as they used to be, the amount of rewards is extremely low and can't even get a 5* without spending or saving for like 3 patches, I loved the game so much but now I no longer enjoy it. i hope you start listen to your fans and players and fix your game."
"I've been downloaded the whole data and its restarted, i kept my phone on and didn't play with it, until i came back to the phone and saw the bar, it was restarted by itself, istg i didn't touch my phone and it's restarted by itself??! how?!!, pls i beg u to fix it hoyoverse."
nice game and I like all characters happy 5.5 everyoneü•∞üéâ
"Why do I always get kicked out of the game? It's kinda annoying now, I have been kicked out of the game for like 6 times already and I don't see any problem on my device that could be the cause of the game kicking me out. Investigate this problem, thank you."
Game so good üò≠üî•‚ù£Ô∏è
"it's a nice game,love itttttt!"
"The game is good, but the problem is all the things you have to delete just to get the app. I deleted some stuff a few months ago, and now that there is a new update, I can not get anything else deleted."
the gacha system is a scam
I hate racist games
I love this game
best game
This one is good üòäüòä
absolute masterpieceü´¶i highly recommend to play this game or atleast once its graphic is off the charts
"Good game, good presentation. But, I hope the devs could listen to the players' voice more because at times the new features can be a bit underwhelming and tedious. All that is left is to apply dark mode option for the loading screen, as white colored background may strain our eyes every time we open the game."
Greedy company
"it is one of the best exploration games i have ever played. the lore of the game is super fantastic and the characters are also well built and the experience they provide is unbeatable on any phone device. If you are looking for a game with adventures and great play style this one is mean for you. Once you are addicted to this game, you will fall in love with this game everyday."
"This game is so GOOD, i like it, the graphics,the character, all of it, i like it all, when i play this game i feel free."
English Voice actors are on strike and rewards are not enough. very disappointed
Hoyo plz gimme Skirk
Cool
i love the game. i played since the first lantern rite. i got all the characters i want... but everything gets repetitive when i reached AR 60... if only there are still more to do rather than artifacts farming and doing commissions everyday.. idk what else to do after spiral abyss and imaginarium.
Ping are always fluctuated
I love the game play and how some of the puzzles are actually in need of actual brain power and not just fighting monsters or timed fighting I also love how much primo gems they give for the bigger chests overall I just love the game the art style and the characters and the storyline
I LOVE THIS GAME NOT GONNA LIE CAUSE THIS IS AN ADVENTURE ALSO IT HAS A STORY AND BACKSTORY IDK WHY THIS GOT 3STAR DOWN BUT IM SURE THIS IS THE BEST GAME
i like This game so much
I love your game
"I love this game! I've been playing it for 4 years now, I've had a few breaks but overall, I think it's pretty fun! The characters are pretty and all! The regions are all pretty and it's a good game."
"Mar/25 Review still stands. Tl;dr game got bigger but not better. The game is not in a god state for new players because the climb up to participate in the better parts of the game has been bad since version 1.0 and still is. With how the tutorials take away player controls, bosses having forced perspective phases, unavoidable projectiles, and mihoyo unwilling to address anything about them directly, I'm not sure if the game will be beginner friendly any time soon. You're welcome to try."
very fun to play and never disappointed .
"I have been playing this game since 4.8, and honestly it's amazing"
pls more reward for f2püòÜ
"it's bad, don't touch this game, it's a curse, I've been cursed to play this game please don't do it, it's as bad as they say YES IT'S LOLI BAIT, God help me out of this place, solid graphics tho"
worst developers they don't even listen to us y'all are greedy af
"Everything released from 1.X-4.X is pretty much amazing, and so good that I can't believe this game is free and on mobile... Kinda fell off recently though. Seriously, what is going on at miHoYo HQ??? Pretty obvious weird last minute rewrites for the new quests, plus this game stopped being a historical fantasy. This game lost its charm with new stuff, other than some lore drops üòû I've played since 1.5 btw, but really started playing frequently on 2.3"
HOYO. STOP MAKING ME LOOSE MY 50/50's PLEASE üò≠üò≠üò≠üôèüôèüôè I CANT DO THIS ANYMORE IT HURTS TO SEE MY PITY SO LOW YET STILL LOOSE 50/50's ON THE CHARACTERS üòîüòîüòîüíîüíîüíîüíîüíîüíîüíîüíîüíîüíî
I love this game very much
add skip dialogue option
"optimization good, finally controller support is here on Android phones."
"puh sepuh ,bagi primonya lebih banyak dong puh sepuh"
I love the game but.. I don't like how it's not giving enough primos and how now things are just fan service...
Please fix the power creep issue and the 4 star rates let us choose a 4 star to have a higher rate than the others because now we hardly ever get free 4 stars and we cant even use old units sometimes because Abyss has these horrible mechanics needing night soul or you will take too long to clear floors unless you use a very specific reaction and its annoying please do something to make combat more fun and different!
"THIS GAME SO FUNN ,YOU WILL NEVER REGRET PLAYING THIS!!, IT'S REALLY GOOD, CAN IT BE THIS GOOD, IS THIS TOO GOOD??!"
downloading problem üòï
"I really, really love and enjoy playing this open world"
"personally this is just what I think but there's not a lot of guys getting added to genshin and so far we only had about 2 males added to natlan and a 3rd coming up. like girls play this game too they want to see male characters. like you have 32 males and like 62 girls, if you add isan and veresa that 64. and I get that your trying to make your game better but we haven't had a male archon in a while. please just make more males and maybe ill be satisfied."
"I'm lonely asf, no friends to talk to. I tried to play this game to atleast find someone to talk to, but I got disappointed cuz grinding rank 16 for nothing... I thought when reached rank 16,I can go to open world where alot of people used to hang out, but that server doesn't exist or that ""feature"" doesn't exist at all. The co-op option is far from the expectation I want."
"The experience over time is getting stagnant with little to no new content, with overall gameplay being a repetitive hellscape to the mercy of the rigged and unfair RNG and game mechanics..."
fun game
do not download if you want a life
best experience and storyline
"this game's devs never listens and will never do ,and the only good thing about it is lore which devs never consider in gameplay"
I LIKE ADVENTURE AND IT HAS THAT
ü§åüî•
i really like the characters
love how this quenched my gambling desires and love from the arlechinno nation.
This is the best game in the world
"genshin-kun, are you watching this?"
"Best open world gacha game, been playing since release and will continue till the end. üêê"
yeah this is fun but I feel bad for the people can't play
"it's pay to win game , they are stingy"
i like this game stories and game plays
"I just started playing a month ago. As time progresses, I started falling in love with the game. Back then, I'd play for hours constantly. It's quite nice, especially to free to play players."
I love this game!
"There's a lot of things, it's unexplainable. But let me tell you, don't quit!"
"Dogshit gameplay, no Endgame, wall-of-text lore, no respect for Veteran players and mindless grinding sprinkled with quite rare good story and great music. That's Genshin Impact in a nutshell. Despite being an hour 1 player, I've got nothing good to say about this game anymore. It's not like the devs care anymore as they gave us an In-game Mail Sort ""QoL"" after a humiliating survey about what's wrong with the game. They know what's wrong but will never fix it because idiots will still pay"
"honestly I wish there was a skip button for story quests and more combat based content like spiral abyss, the theater update is pretty good but it's the same old grinding game over and over again."
best graphics on mobile üí™
best game too relaxing or exploring
I like this game I rate this 10/10
This was my first open world game and it has remained my no 1 since then it has the best story detailing and the most fun gameplay I have seen and most of all it's f2p friendly unlike some games who makes it heavily p2p. As someone who loves fantasy style mmorpg games I think this deserves 5 star more than anyone. (Note: If you are a new player to this game it will be a bit difficult to understand but trust me if you make it halfway through you won't regret it)
"love genshin impact. i have many sweet memory here, especially at inazuma and liyue. yes it is gacha, and yeeees you need to spend to catch em all, but it not mandatory. my friend play as full free player and enjoy the game with normal character. we both enjoy the novelty story and good world building. until Natlan came up. that shieet ruined my game play and many my friend quit because hate natlan."
"nice game but a little bit ""stingy"""
Noise!!
Rlly good
"Really enjoyable. All the criticism I've heard comes from domains which i find find as is, but I'd remove the ""farm on sundays"" feature. Some people criticise the rotten community and the fact that Teyvat has significantly more women than men, but that's mostly just not MiHoyo's fault. the 25 GBs is worth it üëç"
The game is Super fun and story line is awsome but be more f2p friendly.
it's amazing the only thing though is it takes a lot of storage other than that it's worth the storage in my opinion -but it needs a patient person - u have to wait about 2 and a half hours to load the game - it takes a lot of internet though - it was a good game ngl but some natlan characters are looking cringy and also mizuki from inazuma though I hope they creat a better looking characters
"Edit: Came back here to edit again, it's been 1 year & a half since i started playing and the 5.5 update maintenance is going on rn so i decided to re-edit. I've reached AR59 & have been grinding going all out for Veresa & her signature weapon, i hope that I'll be able pull both of them. i honestly still love the game despite all the bad reviews & been active almost everyday since i started playing ‚úåüèª"
"If you don't like the game and keep complaining about the updates... ""Cry louder!"" - Wanderer"
THE ONLY REASON FOR 4* IS CUZ NATLAN REALLY DID NOT DO IT FOR ME. NOT ONLY IS THE REGION NOTHING LIKE PLAYERS EXPECTED BUT THE CHARACTERS ARE ALL TOO OP AND META DEFINING AND HOYO WHERE ARE THE MEN AT???
Perfect
Best game in the world genshin‚ù§Ô∏è
it's beautiful and I love the long slow stories.
"please create harder and more creative puzzle just like inazuma, i also want more exploration experience just like from sumeru dessert! natlan so far is great but it didnt reach the bar set by those 2 regions, the traversal ability it brings are really nice tho, good job dev!"
Best
after every update it want more size üò°üò° I hate this game for it
abusive game
I love the game
"it's so fun! the experience, the game quality, the abilities just wow. but the main problem is having to wait so long to be able to play because how long it takes to download resources. but overall all pretty fun game!"
"aesthetic,gameplay,graphics,for a gacha, it's got the whole package,im glazing but yk :3"
it's the best game I played
thank you for game
"enjoying the game so far!! I liked how realistic it is when it comes to stamina, cooking, strength diff, etc.."
"beautiful graphics and colorful regions, nice sound tracks, if only the new regions, characters and updates were not disappointing. certain abilities for exploration and battles are locked behind characters and there's no consistency in the design/regions. the quality of life updates takes a looooong time to be employed in the game and in the end, many of them do not really improve ur gaming experience."
a very good game if we ignore the fandom
"Terrible wishing system; never gives me anything under 75 pity, especially if you're on the Asian server."
very good but please add more language for other players maybe thay don't know English to enjoy the story
"Hoyo u made an absolute cinema with genshin lore and story, focus on it enough with fanservice n sexualize design, add more useful content or event, and be generous thx üôèüèª"
Yay!!!
"This is one of the best Gacha games I have ever played, this is too good to be free. I have been playing this game for a while now and even got one of my friends to play it, can't wait to see how this game will finish! edit: the amount of potential lost when natlan released makes me severally anxious for endgame. so i will deduct a star. hopefully it will improve 10 fold when the next region comes out"
best experience
"the game is good. i like it. community is 50/50, like every community. the only problem is the weight of the game files. but still a very good games. i cant believe that ppl are gonna hate on the game because on the game characters? if u dont like it, dont play it."
My phone burning just by opening the game. üî• Can you guys optimise it so it doesn't use too much processes on low to mid end phone.
"legit one of the best games I ever played, the story is beautiful the design is incredibly breathtaking and the characters are top notch!!! it's my most comfort games :)"
after the 5.1 update. almost 50-60% characters don't have their English voices. it makes the gaming experience Very bad and uncomfortable
"this game is the best game I ever play on mobile ,"
"AMAZING!! The plot is incredible and there are so many things to do! So many different characters, too, so you can pick your favorite (mine is Xiao). Definitely worth the huge amount of space it takes up."
very fun to play üíûüíû
For me its not just a game but a whole other world where you can do whatever whenever.
"absolutely love it, they could work on more optimization but gameplay is peak, intense battles, which I obv win in first try"
"good, but the story progress is very slow, and a lot of gambling"
nice
it's a fun game but won't let me join even though I updated it what is telling me to update it when I already did
goated
good
I like the exploration experience!
"This game is the best game ever if not the best in the world I love the open world, the story and the quest. I don't know why everyone fails to see the beauty of this game even if it takes up half of your storage but if you ignore all that you will fall in loveü•∞ with this game and I can't wait for version 3.2 hoyoverse keep up the good work üëçüèª. It's been over 4 years since I started playing this game and till this day it's the best open world mobile game I've ever played ‚ù§Ô∏è"
game kikir
i REALLY love the game but I am still pretty sad that hoyo does not create characters that has a darker skin tone or a other body type but don't get me wrong I find every character very creative but maybe some changes will be nice in nieuw characters in the future?????
"I got keqing, now I'm leaving"
nice game‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π
"A game that has been 5 years old but the development is very slow, all the characters just recycle the same animation. It's all done because this game is very stingy and just wants a lot of income. Even though it has a lot of good income, it is very miserly to optimize and provide a pleasant gaming experience."
ŸÑÿπÿ®ÿ© ŸÖÿ±Ÿá ÿ≠ŸÑŸàÿ© Ÿà ŸÖŸÖÿ™ÿπÿ©
"The greatest open world game i ever played, tapi kikir."
"this is one of Hoyoverse's best game out of 2. i really dont like the gameplay like zzz, but its still good. ive been playing since 3.7. but the fan service is getting on people, so i think its better to put a little more of clothes on the next characters"
"Avarage is the name of the game. The lore is cool and there are cool moments in the story and the action is brain dead. The game looks and feels good. The game is good but if you are expecting great or awesome, then you are better of playing wuthering waves or some of the new gacha games coming out in the near future."
"I like this game so much, the view of every nation's are amazing with all those puzzle and quests. just please make the English language are not silent again. keep it up!"
love it!
thanks developer.your music is soooo delicious! but your dilaogue (conversation) is very long!from earth to the neptune!
it's an amazing game!!!!
"es un muy bien juego, buen Dise√±o de personajes e variedad de misiones O encargos"
"It is one of the best phone games currently. I hope you add the Arabic language, please."
I js like gambling
I love it make more games like thisü§ó
takes way too long to download! it's a good game but most games don't take over what like 45 minutes to download! instead of updating effects pls update the time it takes to download!
"why not make your game iOS exclusive since you give priority to their devices, even though Android flagships are more capable, lack of controller üéÆ support and only 60 fps maximum."
"You devs are good persons i know, keep fighting hate, i still remember fly me to the moon :)"
"played since 1.0. I want to play genshin, not honkai waifu only 4th. story and characters have fall so bad with natlan, it's no longer genshin I know. should just remove all the males in game at this point."
great game but time loss
please have a option where you can skip dialogue
The best game i have ever played.
I've been playing this since the release. We need more endgame content we literally only have the abyss and shores and it's getting very boring. The rewards are underwhelming.
it's bad game wuthering waves better than it
Best Mobile Game üëç
good
"I LOVE this game, it helps a lot with relaxing and just playing around the HUGE map. There's a lot to do so don't worry about getting bored!! üíñüíñüíñ"
"I started Genshin back in Sep2023 during my Vacation. I was AR57 by Dec2023. I finally hit AR60 on Feb2025. I really enjoy Archon Quests, Spiral Abyss, Imaginarium Theater and building low usage characters. I have completed everything in this game and now I feel bored cuz there's nothing left to do apart from dailies. I would really love the addition of new end game fighting related contents with server wise leaderboard system to use my built characters, I wouldn't even mind the rewards from it."
"The most beautiful game on mobile platform, astonishing storyline and one of the best games, I have ever played! Bravo üëèüëèüëèüëè"
good story
bro genshin i lost all of my progress and i don't have the energy to play again pls restore my data i dont remember my nickname
God tier
awesome
bring genshin back.. this is not genshin.. please give us something like inazuma ... I'm getting sick of all of this stupid characters... please respect women.. what happened to genshin team?
not spending 50 yrs to install 4 or 5 different things. either it's one install or getfhhhkd. so tired of it. you're not special.
Best RPG Game
"sekarang genshin eventnya terlalu repetitif, terlalu mengandalkan karakter female sebagai target penjualan dan fan service yang berlebihan. Semenjak patch natlan update, genshin serasa kehilangan ciri khasnya, mulai dari story yang agak diulur-ulur, map-nya kurang sesuai Ama ekpektasi saya dan masih banyak lagi. Saya harap dari semua yang saya keluhkan ini dapat didengar langsung oleh developer dan menjadi bahan masukan untuk update patch berikutnya."
"I can't log in my account because it keeps saying ""too many request try again later"" it's been more than two months already. I deleted and installed the game again, tried with another device and the resultd are still the same."
the game is awesome I love the characters animations and all about the game it's awesome recommend
it's really awesome
just perfect
amazing (edit) um so i did 1 star less since fanservice has taken over and this isnt the genshin ive fallen inlove with genshin make a change for us normal players
"i love this game, it's so much fun but you need to put time and effort into it, i wish you don't have to wait 26H just for your resin to reset but I still like it, I'd love it if we got more story quests"
Best game
superb story
"I love that when you log out of the game, it saves your data. The only problem i have is that the load everything takes at least an hour, but everything else is awesome."
F complain impact genshin is cool
so far....I am enjoying the game.New challenges and new characters are making this game more interesting and entertaining
nice game
One of the best game for me but please change the Abyss 12 floor time to 5 min for 3 stars it's so hard I was only able to get 2 stars on every 12 floor chamber üò≠üò≠üò≠
I liked it a little
"I am in love with it ,it's just amazing üëè and beautiful üòç"
"Incredible game, incredible graphics. Too big of a size, and recently tad bit weird designs. It has become impossible to play for me because of the huge amount of space it takes on any device."
great for someone love to discover new stuffs
it's amazing
a trashy greedy game only pay to get what you want that's how this game work or you can play for years to get only 1 or 2 5 stars characters that you want
Amazing
mza aaya
Simply loved it!
"I've been playing this game since the release. been off the game for 2 years then came back few days ago. surprised they didn't add ""skip"" button lol. I've been playin on pc so i couldn't leave a ""review"" there. the game is fun but can get kinda frustrating when loosing 50-50's as a F2P"
Nice game
its a pretty nice game although its very slow and insyead 160 primos there should be 100
more boyss
I really like the game but there's an issue on my sounds when I fight opponent there's a glitching sound effects
best game eveeeeeeeeerrrrrr
me adikted to gacha games
Is game copy Zelda game im so blind to a see map
"Used to enjoy this game so much until the constant fanservice girls and lack of male characters. Natlan actually sucks and there are more than just characters designs, i'm uninstalling."
I like this game I might had played this for more than a year now I really like the idea of exploring all over the world and knowing about its story it's really fun to play!
best graphics best fantasy world best story line üëåüèº
This has to be the best game on playstore
crafting and updating not that much üòîüòï
The weapon pulling system is a scam. Not enough rewards. And not to mention their just a few more male characters.
so good
"such a joke that I love this game so much, realizing all of my characters are hard pity like it so unfair with other players."
ok
one of my favorite open world game
this game is best and good to play
its good for you all!!
All great so 5 stars. -2 stars for natlan !!
my phone as hot as a lava
"It's been 2 years I'm playing Genshin. I love this game a lot! I love the story, character designs, maps & every details about this game. Just I hope Hoyo will make more Male 5‚òÖ characters like Alhaitham,Childe, Ayato character design.Thank you for making my day enjoyable everyday üéÄüå∏"
I mean like is there anything to say other than gambling
it's amazing üòç
Game is good but no controller support 0/10
misleading location director.
good
Trash player treatment and community.
"Amazing, just amazing. Nothing else..."
this is really a good game
Character designs and story telling are getting worse. Quests have missing voiced characters. Arifact farming is disappointing.
fix this it takes so long before downloading all the data I waited like 4 hours
"after playing the game for mote than four years, this is my opinion; there are very good aspects like story, music, character design and many more. combat system gets a little boring after playing for so long and I think it was better if characters had a little more moves or skill but it is still fun. the worst part of the game is wishing system and wishing rules that can potentially affects or even ruin the whole experience still positive aspects, makes it a 5 star game"
peak game
it is crashing now even though it was fine a few days ago
"I love genshin adventures, but please, i want male characters too , not some waifu simp"
"The game is good, but the primogems are stingy... at least give 1600 primogems every month"
top class
My First Time Play A Gacha Game And I Love It
love itt
this is the best game I played
"I've been playing this game for a while. I really liked it, but then when Natlan came out, the game went downhill they took away from African culture but made every character white , and also they added way to much fan service to the game and it pains me to listen the the dialogue, and sometimes the characters voices aren't even there!"
I've been addicted to this game so much!!
incredible.i love it
Great game made by greedy people
best game üéÆ
This game has good combat and good story. I like this.
game lacks male characters. some event stories are very childish.
exactly what I was looking
"It was pretty fun at first. The gameplay was amazing. The story was incredible, but ever since natlan was released, the game got boring to play. Story line seemed rueshed, most characters had chopped backstories, charecters designs were getting boring and more weird if anything. Compared to their other games, genshin just seems like it's rushed now and barely even focused on compared to hsr, hi3, or ZZZ."
this is the best open world game I had played
lwk good

Amazing or perfect game üòÄ I love this üòç this game customer support is very good üëç fast thanks team your help customer service is very fast to listen my problem vi apologies for bad rivew u created ossom game I really love this game I give you 5 star rating lovely genshin impact
dendro was such a cool addition 11/10
"love the game, hate the infinite unskippable dialogue."
"Only fun at first then, it will be boring after a few weeks of playing. All the money hoyo gets from this game went to honkai starrail."

"That's an incredible game but it takes too much of storage, it've filled all my storage! I really don't know what to do with the new update..... üíî"
It's generally nice
Best game ever no more to say
good
your account verification system is very poor
"- Intriguing Storyline:Immerse yourself in a rich narrative involving the seven nations and the Archons who govern them. - Challenging Puzzles and Quests: Solve puzzles, complete quests, and uncover mysteries as you progress through the game. - Multiplayer Co-Op: Team up with friends online to tackle challenges and explore the world together. - Stunning Graphics and Soundtrack: Enjoy beautiful visuals and an orchestral score that enhances the immersive experience."
there so long loading it's taken 1 hour and so lag too
"there was a bug? so now I can't join the games but my sister can and many other people too, this bug on my tablet is not letting me join genshin impact and I wish I didn't waste my time.."
best game ever
super duper open world game I love it üí´üíûüíûüíû
"As a player who started genshin early, only 4 months after release, I have found myself recently losing interest in playing. While I'm not sure what exactly is causing this, it could be related to the new region of Natlan, though I wouldn't say I'm too bothered by it, it's just gotten boring. Everything has been made easy with the new characters and mechanics and you don't have to even use your brain anymore. It's so sad how they're babying new players instead of giving veterans what they need."
"I'm playing for two years. Combat is first grade! I didn't like aspect of 4 characters team in theory..now I love it!! Exploration is just different experience compare to other games. Anime like graphics are beautiful! and Natlan is nice country and characters are decent I don't see same problems like some 1* reviews (people call fan service because of one woman in bike suit? maybe they are too backwater-frigids), kids, women, men, same as always... everyone can find something in their taste."
down right amazing
"game gajelas, udah ngirim kode verifikasi LAMA, pas udh muncul kodenya malah SALAH pula, GAJELAS"
Anazung
i cant download it it just keeps on failing
please add skip button similar to wuwa so players with no time can keep up
best anime game in the world and his story is so cool.
A very engaging game with lots of variety of characters and a great storyline. I recommend it to everyone who is seeking a great storyline in a game.
Good
"It's a wonderful game, beautiful graphics but the downside is that its too big of a game for a mobile device."
"In one word, ""AWESOME"""
"for Varesa. the worst character that was made just for fan service. as a player who has been playing for 4 years, I see that the game is becoming worse and worse. this game let me down"
"The game is super fun great landscape, great character's.....but I and some other would like a new male archon but not only just an archon...we only have two male archon it's would be nice to have one more or two... Thank you in advance... The game is super fun to play."
"I always lost 50/50 whenever pulling recently, it's more worse than a years before. it says before the rate pity lower until 50/50 pull but now feel different. It's hard for me to stay as f2p player. All my wish saving for month gone due rate loss. This game now more like gambling to me, maybe I should quit. Beside the events nowadays more limited."
it's a ripe off of zelda breath of the wild
well I am just writing this cuz I CAN'T DOWNLOAD THE GAME
masterpeice
"I think I'm 70 years old but it's loading is not done to developer """"do not ignore this"""""
one of my favorite games just wish y'all had team chat
incredible
"I love this game, the story line is amazing. it's have a big thick story."
"Fantastic game! Sure, it takes up A LOT of space, but it's all there for a reason. Can't see why people wouldn't like such a calming game. I was trying to find something to play that takes quite a while to complete. I remembered Genshin Impact was something I downloaded years ago but didn't play it due to its space. Now that I had enough of that to play, I did just that. Quite the enjoyable experience, I must say.."
"I've been playing this game for a long time. (F2P, Ar 60, 100% exploration in mond,liyue, & inazuma.) The game was amazing and provided an escape from the reality of life. it was never the best in storytelling, and I felt that even world quests were better. Despite doing surveys every patch, they never listen to their player base. Fontaine was like a breath of fresh air from Sumeru. Game is a HUGE time sink, with little reward for it."
"i love the game and the graphics...but it takes too much data....i only have 64 GB on my phone...please fix this issue, thank you!"
"Easily the best gacha game I've ever played, the graphics, the story, the character designs are all just so good"
nice

It's making me not where to go cause I finished the dangens or temples or tunnel
When I try to enter the game through my mobile it frequently kicks me out It shows that the game has a bug and will be resolved after the developer updates it. What shall I do ? I am really annoyed
I really REALLY WANNA PLAY GENSHIN BUT THE GB IS SO BIG I COULDNT PLAY :(
i love the graphics and characters it's just so detailed
fix your game
I love potatoes but I'm not satisfied with these gifts... Why don't we get gifts like other games developed by Hoyoverse?

really good game!but too heavy.
"Love everything, but I wish we would get better animations with the characters like hsr, it definitely shows that Hoyo's favourite child is hsr. Even the rewards, please take a little inspiration from the comments and update the game a bit. Thank you and I recommend playing it!"
amezing adventure open world game
"as a long-time genshin player, i can only say that the latest patches have been nothing short of disappointing... I am neurodivergent and fixated on genshin, it is one of my special interests. were that not the case, though, I would simply have no reason to keep playing. the soundtrack went from revolutionary to mediocre, the character designs dip in quality and personality every version, natlan's story is clich√©. PLEASE listen to your fans. I truly love genshin, seeing it fall off is saddening."
ok
great game
mantap
"this game just sucks now. there's nothing more to add. it's boring, fanservice, and there's usually nothing to do. you can only use mauvika/citlali in domains and if you don't have them your life is just harder. I personally quit because of this. not to mention, genshin only listens to the Chinese community because they believe they are better then the people in the other servers. natlans release just made genshin worse."
Very nice

"yey finally a xilonen rerun I've been waiting since I lost the chiori weapon banner to xilonen weapon ,I've been grinding good artifacts for xilonen"
good graphics. bad storyline. bad rewards. no incentive to keep playing the game. better to play zzz instead. even wuwa might be better than this garbage.
best gaming experience ever
unused TCG content in game
at this point i only play this game for the characters i like. ever since natlan released this game has been going downhill
"The game is great but it would be much fun if players could trade materials with each other like ""Travelling Merchant"""
nice graphic and gud story line if u r a chill guy wants to play a chill game thiz is it bruh üòé
one of the best games I played
flop game
good game
The fanservice has been becoming too obvious
Great Game
"(redoing to choose a different point of conversation) I hate the new character designs. I started playing before Liyue was even finished, my favorite design is Neuv. there has never been a video game where I have been uncomfortable interacting with characters, and then Natlan began. I started to realize I felt incredibly uncomfortable playing the game, and then I realized why. there's so much sexualization of women that it feels like every character is made now just to have a crush on the mc."
I love the game and it's absolutely gorgeous. And i like the fact you can customize the graphics so it doesn't lag that much. Im at lowet and it looks like it's medium. The characters are good and i never get bored of this game!
i love the game so much and i would like to play it more often but the gb is a bit off ü§£ make it lowet please thank you
I got welkin moon and suddenly the game stopped working when I was playing on it just hours before üôÉ ?????
been playing for two years now and I kinda love the designs and characters and their personalities. the story is engaging and it has some content you can go through at the start but the end game content like the abyss is getting harder with each release forcing you to pull for characters you don't even want but that's not that big of an issue but still I like the game a lot despite the opinions about the natlan release said by some people with unachievable expectations
it's good
Why did not you add the Arabic language?
(Linux pls pls pls pls)
it's pretty good. it has perfect graphic but you can also make the physic more realistic
I like it but we should have an option to skip dialog and all of the characters should get voices in storyline for the people that do watch it instead of only some of them
"tsssk why, i want to play the game but when i log in to my account, it said account doesn't exist. i really want to play the game again."
"Gamenya sih bagus, tapi kenapa gacha gw ampas bgsd"
very good game ( coming from a free-to-play player). It's easier to play on console that mobile but still nice to play üëç
not really ment for slow computers
I don't like this game
"Just stop playing this game. The devs doesn't care anymore, they don't update grpahics, story is mid as heck and no passion is there anymore. What a waste of my time after all these years."
nice game great graphics good story great game I hope you play this game
This Game is Amazing
furina and wanderer haven't met yet (I'll change it to 5 stars when they do)
Amazing
best game
Great game but too bad i cant play it for now the game size is too big i dont have money to upgrade my phone right now but soon i will be back in this game again
I like the grafix to much
Nice adventure
"okay so first of all, this is a great game. Even tho some questst are more boring than other ones I think especially the new Archon quest of Natlan is really interesting. The characters are really well designed and the gameplay and astetics are amazing. As for the quests for us players there is one thing I think all of us need...A skip button!!! literally! that would make quests so much easier. (I only recommend playing on PC tho since most phones can't handle it well...) overall a good game!"
Im player since 2022 but endgame sucks
nice
the best open world game in mobile this game give me vibe of anime movie
op op op op this game really good üíØüíØ
loved it
Nice for now
"I used to like the game and its designs. It was the first game to hit me with creativity so different from other games, but at this point, with the character designs looking like that? You're just a toxic racist company that hates communicating with their community. Edit: Also, with the new endgame content? You all can do better. I played this game for years with little improvement seen, how sad. edit: They are just proving my point with natlan...."
"good at 1st then fall off latter, the developers do not listen to player anymore since they sit on the throne for too long. Almost no investment in improving the game. Paid for monthly welkin for years and never come a skin worth buying, even worse compared to honkai impact 3 as an ex-captain. As a day-1 player it is sad but it seem like it's time to move on."
it's a very good game firstly when i downloaded it i don't know anything so i deleted it but... i downloaded again.. i does all the tasks/quest properly then i saw it's a very good game i really like it!!
"it was great until they started natlan, Mualani was great until .. um Mavuika"
the game is good and all...but it gets borng over time when you realise how unlucky you are...and start to hate the game not having any characters with good strength nor any good characters you wanted (T-T)
AMAZING N BEST GAME EVER WOOOOO üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•

"This game is the best but some people have low end phones so they just complain about that, it's not the game but the phone lol."
I like the map and all the characters but when it comes the downloading Resources I'm so angry with it downloading Resources took me 1 day to download so I rate it 3 stars
Gooner game
very FUN amd EXCITING but kinda hard if grinding
Game is not opening and showing that game has a bug and need to be fixed by the developers
"more male characters pls. too much female chars being fanserviced, lack of male characters, bad rewarding."
"Hoyo, where is my deserved Furina? I did a lot of hardwork for her, getting her signature artifacts and and a good 4 star weapon, but where is my furina? I pulled 40+ pulls for her and still nothing"

OH. EM. GEEEEEEEE
"The game's graphics are very beautiful, and the story"
Good Game üòÅ!!
I quit
Mostly in my main account i've tried climbing many times but have a problem When i try to do kachina and mavuika together Kachina falls down when im climbing and when i try to use mavuika theres a problem i cant use her motorcycle to climb! Fix this pls! And i'll give this app 5 stars overall this game is good
IT'S A REALLY FUN GAME YO EXPLORE CHECK IT OUT
awesome... animation of good quality
"I have been playing this game since 1.1 and it's really good, it's a little detailed for people who don't usually play games but overall it's a fascinating game with gorgeous characters."
I like this game
really a good game
love it
"game yang bagus dan dunianya sangat luas di tambah banyaknya quest quest yang bagus dan mantap tapi ada bug di mana darah karakter saya tiba tiba setengah padahal belum pernah bertarung pas baru login,mohon di cek lagi siapa tau ada kegagalan koding atau lain lain"
"The Game Is An Open World Adventure with so many quests, Hoyoverse Outdone themselves With Genshin As it's one of the most popular games this century"
its cool
good game if you have a good device
yeah the chance of getting your desired 5 star is trash I was supposed to get furina but all I got is Chong Yun after that I got tighary and again I got chongyun until I got his c6 it's pretty much a scam
It's a good game but my old account is gone my old account is login from Facebook and when I am login back to my Facebook account there is a new account created by so can you please give me my old account back
hey I do t know what happened but today my game is not working it says there is a bug in there and it is solved by the developer side can anyone help
"the game is so OP, I love it ‚ù§Ô∏è"
is very good play game if I am boring sometime I. play this game and the story was great to
excellent
like the game except for the gatcha part
"With the recent updates HoYoverse really did a 180 on the whole genre. I hoped for a fantasy yet old world design like Mondstadt, Liyue and Inazuma. But now it's like random modern stuff is being added to the game like the Natlan character weapons like- Plus the Archon quest completely shattered my expectations especially Mavuika's so called secret. Plus the DEVELOPERS don't listen to player feedback at all. Y'all need to change specially in character designs which is blatant sexualization."

"Nice right game, tons of options to explore"
"Add the skip button! Let the players choose whether they want to read it or not. Also, for each and every update and story, we have to download it but there's no option to revisit the stories/cut scenes (there is that option, but only the written dialogues and not as a whole cut scenes). It's frustrating."
"As someone who started playing during the first year of release, I've been experiencing burnout for a while now. The release of fontaine and chenyu vale completely fixed that, but the current versions of natlan makes me want to completely quit the game. Not only do I have to put up with more hours of yapping quests, the rewards are still the same and there aren't even more new male characters to pull. I HATE that hoyo is gearing towards fan service now with all the female characters released"
really good
Good game and Fantastic.
This game is truly fan and can explor about any wher ingame but there are problem that need to be fixed like .I am in mobile after a sertain amount of time whe two character speak the speaking sound dose not come
i love it's
good
high quality details very fun to play the map is very big and the main story line is very nice
thank you so I can.
I rated 5 star coz I like 5 things about genshin impact 1.Nice graphics 2.good story.3 comfortable control movements 4.characters including Archon 5.rewards & special events. so tnq developer for presenting such awesome.! game
"I used to love Genshin, thanks to my friend introducing it, but I lost many 50/50s, and the story just gets tiring. Not to mention the fanservice they've been adding now. I'm sorry, I don't like this game anymore."
i love it!
good
"How is that, I can't play with control?"
"Less and less rewarding. It's an alright game but waaaay too ""family friendly"" making all the quests extremely boring and repetitive. Very long quests. Boring but complicated and asenine puzzles. Game devs are very stingy and dont change snything unless you're the CN or JP player base. Honkai Star Rail is a MUCH better game. Way more interesting side quests. This? I'm only still playing to get certain characters. Thats the ONLY fun part sadly."
"it's sooo fun, I've made friends and meeting other people, idk why they always compare this to other games when you can just enjoy both:("
very nice
honestly really good for casual use. don't actually need to spend lots as most characters are fairly comparable. Grinding is a real chore . for example I have a nevueliete but grinding it's resources to the recommended lvl 80 is soo hard . Like bro I wanna use this op character now not in 10 years
"I agree with many others here. Genshin has become little more than a waifu similator aimed to keep its non grass-touching patrons from leaving. The dialogue is a nightmare to deal with, given there's no skip button, and the rewards are far too little to do a whole lot with. Natlan fell apart, and IMO, Varesa is an affront to life itself. Everyone who used to be good has been powercrept like crazy, and have been neglected for ages. It's a true shame how Hoyo doesn't listen to players wants."
perfect
Great
I played this game for ages i made it up to ar 55 and had a good amout of characters only to come on the next day to see i was signed out when i logged back in everything had restarted and ive lost everything
"I'm unable to open the app, it says there's some kind of bug? üíî"

Reply- i have the space 200gb left still makes no sense were forced to download the whole game before we can access these settings. Theres no settings on the download page. Give us the tutorial/first area or world first let us see if we enjoy the game and want to play more before wasting ur day downloading the whole game to uninstall that night because u dont enjoy it or whatever."

"it's a great game and all, but it lags so much especially if you have less than 8 ram. I have 6 ram and it's a 50/50, it lags sometimes and sometimes it doesn't. I would also like to complain that recently I lost my alt account at AR 23, when I tried using the Gmail for it, it didn't log me into the account and instead gave me a new account, using the email I used for my alt account. it upsets me to know that I lost all my hardwork, the account is still up and not banned, pls fix this hoyo."

"Why when I want to enter a place it take a long time like 31,0000 ARE YOU KIDDING ME?! IT DESERVES 3 STARS WHY ISN'T IT 100 ONLY?!!!"
it's the best with great story and good graphics
"This is really a five star rated game,i love this game.This game has real-life grafics real-life experience and more.You need to play this game for real-life experience.And one more thing this game only takes 30 GBüòî. So be Careful. Genshin Impact, character roles are broadly categorized as Main DPS, Sub DPS, Support, and Healer, with each role contributing to team composition and combat effectiveness. Here's a breakdown of each role: Main DPS: The primary damage dealer, typically on the field."
i'loveit
It's my favorite game forever.
"gameplay all the same, dialogue takes too much time there is no even skip button. gachas very low chance of getting characters. wastes my money on this game been stop playing it over 3 years and came back still the same."
best reference's
.Super fun .lots of activities to do .amazing sceneries . amazing voice acting . amazing stories .battery draining .time taking to finish some quests .better quality crashes the game for me
RELEASE IFA AND LET HIM COME TO ME
"this is a very good game and I love the characters and storyline, it's kinda difficult to find primogems and I usually get stuck because of things I can't beat but overall it's a really fun game and everyone game has it's bad things so this is a really good game in my opinion üëç"
great
Artifact farming is horrible!!!! I have been doing VV domain for 1 yr now and I got like 50 EM Maiden's Beloved but only 2 EM VV pieces. Absolute trash! Sanctifying elixirs are extremely hard to get & crafting good artifacts cost 3-4 of them. Horrible! And recent introduction of Capturing Radiance has done no good for me cause I still lost 50/50 three times when wishing for my fav characters and had to spend more than 140 wishes to get a single 5 star. Very pathetic if u ask me. Do better hoyo
it's so good wort downloading it
I like this game but why do I have to wait for years to get the characters that I like even if I am willing to spend money.and problem can be solved easily by either 3 banner or chronicle wish banner every patch.üò≠
Sigma game
nice
worst game. The more i played the more i realized this company don't care about their players one of the most predatory company the weapon banner is a scam and you can only clear endgame content with c6 characters the story became boring and the events are also boring and repetitive im bored of this game and will quit it soon they are just releasing filler patches now it's not interesting or fun to play anymore it's feels like I'm doing a chore honestly if could give genshin zero stars i would.
the majority of people who plays this game like little children üíî
cool
"not updating the core mechanics of the game, rather focusing players' attention on events and more, more quests. Battling, banners, domains, all of that ‚Äî must be reworked or changed slightly."
love it
best game üòé
"Why Arlechino one shot my aether. He had five elements but still is so weak in lore. I am dropping the game. Bye bye paimon. Very bad story writing, my poor aether is still so weak after 3 years. He always gets beaten up by everyone üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠üò≠"

amazing game and the story line is so good üëç
"Fix the ""connection timeout"" problem please"
the game is amazing but pls give me Eula this anniversary
"it's a nice game with the graphic qualities and all I love , it's been my favourite game ever since"
Ill weather wl7 anyway. But from thr positive side i wil be gettign better drops i suppose. Please let us lowered World Level not just one step but two. It would cure all the problem people are facing because of the clusmy ascension. That wouldn't hurt anyone. Those who love to play with ease for story and exploration will play with low difficulty and those who like challenge will do thr hard wl for better rewards. It's a win win scenerio! Id suggest it over everything else
really fun

The farming of primogems is so boring so i quite this game
I absolutely love Genshin I've been playing it since 2023 it's sooo funn!! idk why ppl hate on it it's absolutely great!! love u Genshin!!!
"Genshin Impact features a vast, beautiful, and explorable world, allowing players to traverse diverse landscapes and uncover secrets. The game's combat system is known for its dynamic and engaging nature, utilizing elemental magic and character-switching for strategic gameplay. The game's art style, with its vibrant colors and character designs, appeals to a wide audience, particularly those drawn to anime aesthetics."
"I love this game!! In my opinion, this is probably the best game i've got on android. I used to play this when I was little, but now I've got a phone, I got the game right away. I recommend this game to people who like action mixed with adventure. 5/5!! Play now üòô‚ù§Ô∏è"
"although i love the design of the game and the overworle, this game has terrible rewards, a lack of primogems and wishes from events, and the genesis crystals are just so so expensive"
"This game is getting worse and worse. characters design that doesn't even fit their nation. Gameplay wise is also getting bad, instead of increasing the probability of rng in artifacts they focus in increasing the enemy level. Abyss is getting powercreep to the point you need certain character for a certaint nation for the enemy boss. what if i dont have it nor build it? ESPECIALLY THE PITY IN WEAPON EVEN THOU THEY REDUCED IT TO 1 THE PROBABILITY IS STILL THE SAME. IF I COULD GIVE NEGATE REVIEWS"
great
predatory prices
"An ad for this game came on my phone in the middle of class and everyone thought it was hentai. I can never show my face at school again. I've never played but, but it seems kinda mid anyways"
I love it! It is a wonderful open world game giving a very immersive experience.
Very good game but for some reason I can't download this version and I have to download the cloud version
"this game is so good I've been playing it since 1.6 I liked graphic, gameplay, story, but it has problems of boring side quests"
its hard to comeback to this game it's lifeless and boring. it requires you to play daily that's what makes me burn out playing this game.
"simply just the community guidelines and tos issue, and company doesnt listen to player. the game has given good experience but now it seems bland and half-assed."
it's pretty cool but it becomes boring fast ngl. also its annoying getting artifacts for your charaters bc you need like higher levels to get them and for me to have higher levels and better charaters i need them. i havent played this in so long so it probably changed but probably not
cool graphics but when will Genshin impact 3.00come out
"Downloaded the app and couldn't even play/launch game. Just gave me a pop-up msg saying: ""Something went wrong with Genshin Impact. Genshin Impact has a bug. Try updating this app once the developer provides a fix for this error."""
good game
"As an F2P timed events are a big downside for me. I am adult who don't get lot of time on hands, sometimes I am missing out on events which contain main characters just because I was too late. It would be nice if these events last at least for 3 months instead of 21 days. That is the only downside."
"It's size is little big but it deserves, It's an awesome adventure game and I like it"
"After 2 years of leaving this game, I finally got back on it and enjoys playing this game"
"I played this game for the first time and I really like it, it is one of the best games I have ever played."
is this game fun
I am a new player but I must say : this game is amazing ü§©üòç
Lately endgame has been unnecessarily annoying for players without latest characters. I believe it's a deliberate marketing strategy and I absolutely hate it.
I'm not stupid like others who don't accept that fact that you're being more greedy each update
BEST Game Of the Years üíöüíöüíö
"one of the best or even the best game that I have ever played in my life, totally recommend"
I love Genshin ‚ù§Ô∏è I get addicted to it after every update.
perfect Game... full satisfaction
so fun to play if you want to try something different.

Great game. But needs to listen to the community. Been waiting for controller support for a 4 years. Still not the greatest to play on Android. IOS has controller support and that was patched in almost a year ago. If anything let us use 3rd party apps to configure controllers.
that's really cool
intinya bagus
love this game so much but the loading screen when i first played it really tested my patience
The best details and it's like 3D anime
Love the game it just needs to be optimised for lower end devices like mine that's has 4+4gb Ram cos the game on low graphics has like characters glitching hope u fix this cos I love this game man can't wait for more uptades in the future‚ù§Ô∏èüíØ
good
Possibly best game i've ever played. I can literally never get bored from it.
i am playing the latest version of the game and game should be optimizated more and stamina ends so fast than i thought i think when you run with character your stamina shouldnt effect
bro this game is Souper games in the world ‚ù§Ô∏èüê±
great game
good game for adventures
natlan looks like a joke pls take an example of honkai star rail
adventure experience fantastic graphics game üéÆüéØ
"One of the best games with the best storylines! I am just a person who appreciates the amount of effort in those small details. I do not really care about the damage, I only roll for the characters that I like. And this is really one of the best games! However, the storyline damn long leh!"
very bad game so many ADSüòÇ
this game is intresting and have a cool adventure in the game with friends and one more thing you have to decrease the GB for the Mobil players to have better graphics

been playing since it came out ! never a day i wouldn't play ü©∑ so well made and just a never ending adventure

i love this game so so soo much ugh
Very good game üëç
Eat a lot on storage space.
it is one of the best games i have played in my lifetime. never have i ever gotten bored of playing this game. And the storyline is also great. You will definitely enjoy every moment of this game.
this game is very fun and i like it
"in 5.4B, why is the 12th floor spiral abyss bosses so hard, the boss does not make sense for the f2p players. so hard to beat them. I wish the boss would get balance with the players."
"Storyline is good tho apart from it, it's kinda boring in terms of grinding and this game has way too much fan service lately which is totally not okay"
"the graphics are great but this game is such a HUGE COPY of legend of zelda, and it uses so much space, the files are huge the game is really laggy, you need to wait 2 hours for it to download the files and i just dont think all that is worth risking for a ripoff game."
I'm a bit upset it's to much storage for me I removed all my apps including videos and pictures and it's still not enough also I'm new here and I can't seem to download the data packs because it keeps saying full storage :(
very good Quality but I am angry üò° for this game strage is 33 GB what
I am facing an issue `Genshin impact has an bug` I can't open the game .
"I'd appreciate the quality of life features Hoyo puts in other games here in Genshin, but otherwise I enjoy my experience. I would also like tougher fights. He Doesn't Die does indeed die very quickly to my Navia team with Furina included. Exploration is really great in general, but Natlan has been peak for that imo. Fully orchestrated soundtrack is fantastic, but I'm so strong I don't get to enjoy combat music much which are typically the best songs imo."
"Natlan ruined everything, especially Varesa üíî"
it's large size file is problem to new player . 30 gb is very big size for new player and low devices
your ID always gets hacked when you make it much nicer with high crit rate and crit damage with 90 percent exploration and Game never takes some action against these lots of HACKERS
"I play this game on pc,ps4,and my phone.I love it,I just wished the travelers would have outfits for each region."
i am so edicted
"I've played since the release date and love it, but Natlan was a huge letdown. The story was just okay, and the characters felt out of place, losing the fantasy charm. HoYoverse is focusing too much on fanservice and overpowered damage instead of the deep lore and balanced gameplay that made Genshin great. Wake up, Hoyo! I've never wanted a region to pass as quickly as this one. I really hope Snezhnaya brings back the charm with strong storytelling, balanced characters, and meaningful designs."
"SUUUPER Meh game, the game feels slow, natlan is lacking some ""Nation"" and did I mention is slow? wait, why is it slow? probably cuz I waste no money and I get jumped by the horrible qol. Did I mention it's slow? WHY IS IFA SO... mid(I love men) did I mention it's slow? did I mention it's slow? genshin was alr in its first days, wuwa is a cool game, my device is bad so I can't play it well. genshin please listen to your players (not me though stay safe)"
make more characters that can summon allies please
good
good game
"Great storyline all over the chapter and every *characters story with their background was perfect with their VA, but sometimes when event pop up, the character on the event being MUTED (you know what I mean). that's really disappointed Thanks for your hard work, hope you guys could added their VA to the game in EVERY dialogue"
love this game
such a great game there's so many to explore I recommend this game
When I tell you my jaw dropped when I first loaded into the game and saw all the scenery and lands and all the characters I could collect and places I explored and all the quests I completed I fell in love with this game TYSM for making it (‚ú®)
ŸÑÿπÿ®ÿ™Ÿä ÿßŸÑŸÖŸÅÿ∂ŸÑÿ©
I've been playing this game a year ago and the only thing that I can say is this game is so good... üòé
Boring patch.
Furina wouldn't come home
good
"A game with lots and lots of wasted potential, such a shame. let us skip stories like your other games, it's getting really boring"
This game's pity system and artifact system are cursed. The resin capacity and regeneration isn't enough to deal with its poor system.
delaying security code
thanks genshin impact you gave me knowledge about elements and enjoy at the same time. exploring teyvat is wonderful
wawwwwww
seru ae udah
Great game only issue is with my phone playing for long time the phone gets overheated Game is absolute masterpiece
it's really relaxing

Amazing game playing it since 1.2
"The best game I ever played in my life till now. The story, open world gameplay, characters abilities and designs everything fits my requirements. I would highly suggest this game to everyone"
amazingü§© gameüéÆ
Paywall game
"I still enjoy playing the game when there are updates, but it takes up way too much storage and I can no longer play it on mobile."
"bug. it won't let me open the app. i tried clearing catcha & data. it didn't work. i tried uninstalling and reinstalling, the reinstalling can't be completed because that bug won't let me open the app."
great :)
After update it encountered bug. Jist forced closed.
I have a question for the developers-Do you guys ever listen anything from the players and applied it in game ?What the hell is wrong with you guys ? I have top tier character with top tier build but some other players complete the abyss without having good character and build but I'm suffering in abyss .Their dmg output is insane but I can't even see it in my account .I have better build than them .So what is happening ? If u guys are not going to fix the game I'm going to leave it .
it's beautiful travel game
very good story and great adventure
"This game is fantastic in every way ( for me ) . I have enjoyed this game from the beginning still now .lt has its quality and since 2020 it's improving. Other freaks who don't like this game stay away from it, nobody need your negative opinion anyway. Many of the game can't ever copy it's unique feature which is the elemental reaction in here(play store).Besides this game's story and lore is great .AND if some freaks still have high expectations go find other games you don't deserve it anyway."
"interesting game, great story"
gooner game
nice game
I GOT FURINA ONLY WITH 21 WISHS
"Its a great game to dedicate a couple of hours or an hour in, if you do not have much time this game is perfect for you, it gets updates and events that will keep you doing something everyday. Just do not rush things or you will get tired and mad like the other reviews in here, this game is to be taken slowly, not a race."
a really good game
the login is a bit annoying but it's worth itü§©
Natlan was really bad
its a wonderful game
"Tamam hikayeler g√ºzel, m√ºzikler g√ºzel, kontroller fena deƒüil fakat bunlar dƒ±≈üƒ±nda tonlarca eksiƒüi var. Mesela ben √∂nceki etkinliklerin hikayelerini g√∂rmedim, bilmiyorum.

boring
Please add the Arabic language to the game.
"Mid, not worth it"
"It's a very fun game and keeps me occupied, but I just wish it didn't take long to load and crash a lot."
its a good game
very nice game
It's a really good game and there's alot of adventures and places to explore!
I love everything about it I hate people who thinks the game is fanservice!
Still no Controller Support.
"I've been playing genshin since Inazuma's ending & until fountain this was my favourite game but after natlan came everything went downwards, the characters no longer have unique personalities or designs, no men, mostly white women who simp for mc, boring. The story also feels flat cuz they prioritize the fanservice, compared to previous nations, rlly bad. so many other issues, overall after all these years Ig I have grown tired of the developers getting greedier & never listening to us. bye."
Ptw.
I got so Luke
trash game don't upload
Nice game üéÆ
best game
I like the game style and storyline impact they're very good at me but I hate it because of the resin still need to wait too long I don't have any game to play It was so bored to wait can this be updated it by unlimited resin?
beautiful
Its very fun game!! But it just ate soo much gb and data
wow thats are a mey zing
I love this game!! I totally recommend it!
"Either die a hero or live long enough to see yourself become the villain. This holds true for Hoyoverse. Genshin was a great game that pioneered the space but ultimately fell short and behind due to negligence by its creators. Hoyo developers refuse to listen to the community and have given up. Therefore, I have given up and will play games that reward my time. I suggest you do the same; don't let bullies win."
"I've got nothing to say, just added it here to convince hoyo to add a skip button to the game."
best app
"This game has lost it's charm which it used to have, it just an greedy corporate game right now and the fan base is so toxic that muslim will lose against them all and all this game sucks. ( I have been playing this game from day 1 when it launched)"
"I'm happy to get back to this game. I couldn't retrieve my old account back sadly i just started over. What i realized in my life is you can create your own happiness, and you can be content with even the little things like this situation."

absolutely love the experience so far
I really like this game alot
good
"it's good but kinda of greedy in terms of grinding stuff and the gameplay was kinda off good somehow, the only thing that I'm quitting playing the game is there's no skip button to every story and I'm not even bothered to go through it since I'm still in inazuma..even the side stories don't have skip button to it...I think the characters are getting to fan service at some point. I don't see any New Male character. I'm not even happy about how the resin works."
"this was my favorite game since version 1.0 but now it's just getting boring, the unnecessary gameplay of new devices and characters"
"love the game, just not able to play it completely because i have a slow computer :( i am kinda-able to play the cloud version.! but can a web version be made (sorry iff its too big to ask) but i love the game, and have an account for it, just not able to play as much as ii wish i was able to"
pretty good üòç
"it just got so bad, i hate natland and how the character became, the exploration too and all the bosses that are made just for a specific character to make it relevant, the plot became boring too like the new areas, i just came back from time to time for reruns but i don t even have primos anymore cause i m done with exploring everything except natland"
not bad tbh.
I love this game BC it is the best game in my phone but it takes a large space in my phone üì±ü§≥üèª
perfect
"I love the game!! It's my comfort game, their are times where I kinda wish there was a skip button, cause I was just doing stuff over and over again, so I just want hoyo to add a skip button! it always makes me happy when updates come and I highly recommend you play it!"
"this game friends have no fan service,not at all but very little,you all must understand that showing skin doesn't instantly makes it fan service,if you take this logic to reality and think the same way about any woman in reality you have some serious issues, praying for your future girlfriends or boyfriends"
"decided to delete this game cause too much talk, hard leveling up, pay to win."
the best I have come a cross. I love it.
"Best game ever,been playing since release"
not much to say... this is the best game available on android
"If you came for the gacha, look elsewhere. I will never appreciate a system with items AND units in the same pulls to muddy the chances of getting new characters. Plus, the drop rates are bad to begin with. However, if you're looking for a well-voiced, beautifully crafted experience with a world full of nuance and many ideas inspired by an amazing IP, then you've come to the right place. There is a lot to explore, barely even out of the tutorial, and there is still so much more to find."
Terrible game
Good
good
"Imi pare rau pt acel rating, am zis sa revin cu ce am aflat. De vina era tel, poate pt ca avea 2 ani vechime, poate era depasit. Ce vreau sa zic este ca este un joc excelent, poate cel mai bun jucat in ultima perioada. Pe Samsung a50 a mers cu greu, dar pe a52 nu am nicio problema. Recomand!"
beautiful game very good
"Amazing for a free open world game. In my opinion, it hasnt grown in the ways it needs to. The storyline is great. They have some issues with character building, specifically if you get an inazuma character at the start. Im editing my review because i didn't take the fact that it's fully free. I respect this game, but if you're looking for a game that's a more fast-paced moving and creative way of fighting, go with tof or wuwa or even HI3. If you want a story, then this is a great find."
"(This is a 4 star review only because I haven't really played the game much, thus can't rate the story) Installed this just to try frame generation (as well as maxed out settings) on the redmagic 10 pro. I am quite satisfied. Game looks good and runs good. Now I know it's absolutely not essential, but a native 120fps option would be nice, as frame gen from 60 to 120fps is easier to run than true 120fps, thus uninteresting, AND I really want to see the gigantic raw performance of my phone."
can't begin to explain how awesome this game is
I like this game is so realistic and nostalgia üßéü•Äü•Äü•Ä

Too good story
There is absolutely no need to force updates in a single player game
the best game i have ever played fantastic graphics
could be better
hi this is feedback. I play genshin on GeForce on notebook and when i do the lirion chalenge a didn't have the best score but it gived me the chest and i opened all the chests. After that I went to do the challenge again and i did it but it didn't give me the Green ring
boring
Too predatorial
best game
good
"The visuals of this game are magnificent. There are many awe-inspiring structures, landscapes and monuments that reveal much about the richness of the lore buried deep within. The world feels rich and lifelike and it is a pleasure to explore. The soundtrack and music is ethereal, giving an intense sense of immersion. The story is slow paced, yet is filled with mysterious and thrilling elements throughout. The characters with their voicelines and stories feel a part of the greater world of Teyvat"
"Love the game, I pretty recently started playing and quickly became obsessed. There's a few issues though, my storage is very quickly running out and with each update the lingering fear that my phone will not longer be able to take it is there, I don't have a PC or gaming console that would support this game either so mobile is all I have. I'd hate to have to quit just because of this. Second I feel like the characters as a whole just keep disappointing a bit, compared to in other hoyo games"
Overall this game is excellent! Really like how they make each character way of talking seems full of joy and have they're own life into it.
the best game I ever played worth of the net it consumed it's a blessing to get a game like this in mobile
nice
good graphics good story line but what it lacks is that sometimes it feel like you play a love game with fan service (iykyk)
A most enjoyable wonderful game ever I saw
The developers have abandoned rhyme and reason for greed. You would think a game that made nearly 2 billion dollars in the first year would not minmax ripping off their users.
uhhhh Kk Idk how to play this but Imma give this game a 5 star
"It's already 2025, it's been almost 5 years. Why Hoyo? Why is there still no resin storage system when it exceeds the storage threshold? Not all of your players have time to play all the time. Please provide your best solution. Edit: Connection is really bad, even when I play on my best server the connection is still the same. What's happening here? Are you done maintaining your service? Loser."
very nice
"hmph, as a player that has been playing for the past 3 years, im honestly disappointed. It feels like a chore game.. Firstly, R the genshin devs listing at this point on QoL. There have still been a bunch of requests of QoL since the past 5 yrs that have not been implemented. Next is the characters they look good, but the male to female ratio is kinda concerning bec it also a female release more than a male char since Natlan or Fontaine released. Lastly, theres so many improvements to this game."
Better than starrail and wuwa
I have been playing since 1.1 and this game still is very interesting and full of mysteries. I just love that they put hu tao because we have the same birthday.
Very good
"absolutely a horrid game with little rewards given, this game is only for those who have money, in fact I only noticed I was deceived a lot by how their other competitors such as wuthering waves do so well with their character model, animations and NPC designs, this game has a multinillionaire company yet greedy."
Playing for almost 4 years and the game has fallen off harshly since Natlan released. Wouldn't recommend playing this game anymore.
really cool lore
the best game!!! like
"game feels so repetitive, farming artifacts sucks cause it's hard to have a good or even decent piece of artifacts that it doesn't feel rewarding to pay attention to anymore. the rewards in events are little. another thing, game asks for survey but hardly listens to their players that it's getting frustrating and tiring to play the game."
"in love w this game since I first discovered it in 2020. I love the story, he characters, and all.. but the game has been evolving so much, it takes up too much space."
"Nothing to say, it's best tho-"
I'm a gamer but this game bad
it's an amazing game and has the best storyline without doubt it's the best game and you must try this
I love Genshin. When I'm having a bad day Genshin always cheers me up.
game is best just need to fix little bit system

"Game is 10/10, I loved the game, and it's beautiful quality, if you are bored, or just want entertainment, this is best for you! same goes for lore lovers, this game has A LOT of lore, featuring each region, characters, even weapons, and foods, like their origins, they give minor details, that connects to the main storyline, also...for y'all girlies who simp for anime boys..this one is for you ;)"
gooner game
Good graphics but needs to be light weight
"This game used to be the best mobile game for me however it's just becoming repetitive, story wise it dragging with the Natlan being so far from the title ""nation of war"". recent characters are not aligned with their nation and I thought that it's just coincidence that I lost at the same time with my pulls on GI, ZZZ and HSR before then it happens again today, just recently I loost my pulls again in ZZZ first, then spent money again on GI to lose my pull then today I lost pull on mydei banner."
bad
it is one of the game which allows you to play story mode in mobile with high graphics
The game deserves 5 stars but unfortunately I give 3 because of the dialogue time and the too much frustration I do not have much time seeing all this. There is not any skip button.
nice
pretty fun
Nc more futures
Was not sure at first but the starting 10 minutes were enough to get me hooked on to this
Great game art is amazing but do not play on mobile it will lag and crash.the game is relatively f2p friendly but after a while the game can be stale since grinding for pulls is all you do and when you do get the 5 star character ou just grind to power them up.
Sooooo
"actually it's nice, i was playing it since 2021. but, it's getting really boring by it's new event's and characters, actually i even feel it's really out of genshin now. especially the new area, natlan, it has a lot of unnecessary ""technology"" and future stuff, i thought it was a completely fantasy game. put that all aside not to mention the game started crashing and lagging, like really really hard, especially in new areas. it wss never like this before... i hope these stupid things getting fix"
"This game takes up TOO MUCH storage. It takes about 25GBs to begin with. The game itself is annoying because it's a pay to win game. You pay for better pulls so you can ACTUALLY play the game and not die. And it seems to only be fan service right now. There are so many mobile games that are exactly like this for less storage. This company made over a billion dollars, and it can't even fix its storage issues. This is why people are leaving your game. I could go on, but they gave me a word limit."
Please wnderer rerun
Nice to play
"Gameplay has always been repetitive but i don't mind, back then. Now, it feels like it's getting boring, the new characters are kind of bland too, and so is the new region and all. I still enjoy playing it, sometimes."
they buried themselves into this
"This game is top tier. Music, Characters, Graphics, World building, I feel like it's got something for everyone. That said there are things that players wish would be improved, but none of it all bad for amazing experience it is. I encourage everyone to give it a try, you never know how you will feel about it until you do! :) Good luck and have fun!"
The best game ever
I love it üòò
this was so beautiful i really like all the characters specially their splash art üé® and i really cried in others quest but its hard to earn primos
Nice game
Too long to load
Nice game but they should make the pity lower for those who are f2p
nice
I spend 150pull in game but i not get furina and pull was not showing in history
Add horses to the game and let us race in Mondstadt with characters i beg on my knees i love horse racing in games üêé
üëçüèªüëçüèª
sucks
"I come and go with reviews on Genshin Impact. When they do well, I delete the 1 star review. When the Developer fail, I write a one star. I have spent $360 usd on my Genshin experience. That's a lot. When the game mechanics fail, and glitches break conventional play, that means no spending. The current Abyss Cycle is ignoring character iFrame, a game mechanism that allows you to not take game damage while casting and Elemental Burst. Meta should not mean boss cheats."
best anime 3d adventure game I've played love it
I dont understand at the morning i can play genshin but now the app just close whenever i open genshin can u please fix that problem i can open zzz hsr but i cant open genshin please fix it
I love it!
It's a good experience
"Genshin Impact is an absolutely stunning game with breathtaking open-world exploration, captivating lore, and an amazing soundtrack. The graphics are top-tier, and the character designs are outstanding. Combat is fluid and engaging, with plenty of strategic depth. Regular updates keep the game fresh with new content, events, and characters. While gacha can be challenging, the experience remains rewarding. A must-play for RPG and adventure fans!"
Disgusting character design not suitable for kids
"This game is great and all, but lately, i can't enter the game. It stops at the loading screen and says i don't have a good network when i clearly do."
Nice game
"still deserves a 5 star. why. because almost nothing else with this level of polish exists on the mobile gacha hemisphere. Go find another open world gacha with this level of polish, then come talk. but facts are facts. this new direction of powercreep waifu simulator is not looking good. not at all Hoyo."
"Please make resource management features cause the size is absolutely big for mobiles, decrease the mumbling story, and fix the joystick for mobile"
"Genshin Impact is an amazing open-world RPG with stunning visuals, smooth animations, and an engaging story. I‚Äôve been a fan since 2021-22 but fully experienced it after upgrading my phone in 2024. The game has multiple language options, yet Hindi voiceovers are missing. India has a huge gaming community, and adding proper Hindi voices (not just translations) would make it more immersive. I hope Cognosphere PTE. LTD. (HoYoverse) considers this in future updates."
awesomeee
ŸÑÿπÿ®ÿ© ŸÇŸÖÿßŸÖŸäÿ©
Devd do not care about the players at all.
I am not able to clear trial of tianqiu I mean it may be possible in pc but certainly not possible in phones and please take into account of mobile users also I lost all interest in that game once that quest became impossible and without that I can't other ones
I love it so much<3
This is the best open word game I have ever seen and played the dev have done a great job making this game the story is so good I have enjoyed the story
Good game
0 voice actors
I LOVE THIS GAMEE!! however i think not really beginner friendly.. you have to do ALOT in the beginning but it explains everything so well! Its easily a 5 star
2nd to the best game
This game gives me anxiety.
Nice game
game 's graphics was good but the dialogues is worst ü§¢ü§Æü§Æü§Æunrelavent convos
"Hey hoyo! I wanna ask you a question if that's okay with you. is Genshin impact just a crash grab and you don't actually care about it? are you only focusing on hsr and zzz. because I've actually never seen you listening to your players. and I've seen videos and posts about the official star rail and zzz accounts responding to fans promising changes. but Genshin. can you do us a favor and also listen to us instead of listening to CN players most of the time, please? we also exist not just them."
amazing ü•≥
Best game I ever played
This game is best
I love this game graphic and the story is cool all character have a power moster have too that why I give 5 Star to this game !
worst it just keep downloading... it's been 2 days i kept downloding only :/
I'm a long time player here and don't get me wrong I love genshin impact but. Its the character voice strikes. It throws me off when a certain character doesn't have a voiceless or doesn't speak when they have to in the story. Please fix this.
very nice game
I had a really bad audio combat experience since the latest patch. The audio was really buggy and it's really annoying when fighting with mobs. Pls fixx this I really want to enjoy the beautiful music without the bug:((
Good üëçüòä
üëçüí™üí™üí™üëçüëç
"I really love genshin and I wanted to play it so bad but it just takes so long to download and so long I mean SO LONGGG. it's not like I don't have enough storage or I have bad internet, but it still won't download!! after it got to 50% it just stopped downloading. I hope they fix this, just at least make it take 10 hours to download because I waited over 13 hours and it was 50%."
Damn!
"I think you should balance the characters power status, some are overpowered, and some are too weak. It's kinda unfair, that we want to use some characters, they do little dmg, so we can't even enjoy using them. And we request to revamp some old characters too, and at least give them some new power up."
"One of the best game I have played so far love the storytelling, love art stay and game has good combat as well as very relaxing and have absolutely amazing music I have ever heard in a video game love it 100/10. üíúüíúüíúüíú"
damnn.. graphics.. I love this game.. ‚ú®üéÄ
just plz give an opportunity to change the traveler to switch to lumine ot ather once after choosing
very good
"I like the beautiful scenery, but character designs are worsening. I'm not interested at all of natlan's character designs. Also for the upcoming Snezhnaya region , why capitano and dottore wear such a mask on their face with uninteresting wardrobe?? Very bad design. I have been waiting for adult male characters but... your character design is getting worse and worse. Very dissapointing."
very very good game
I like this game
nice but it lags sometimes so am giving 4
"At first, amazing. Ive been playing this game for two or more years now and have thoroughly enjoyed it. However... after Natlan released, the game just seemed to fall off. The game has become a waifu simulator and only 2 male characters have been released since; One is a 4 star and one is basically irrelevant to the plotline. The storyline was okay but I have to say it definitely wasn't nearly as good as the previous nations. Overall, wouldn't recommend."
boring game
Maybe add controller support on android devices too.
"Devs refuses to improve the game acting like they're still the king. Covid buff is gone and competition has entered the scene, locking QoL behind paywalled characters no longer flies for many and the artificially stoping players enjoyment of the game has become dated. Almost 5 years and still no skip button, out of combat you run for 10s and you're out of breath, cannot farm on specific days, artifact Loadouts still not added. With every patch game becomes greedier and quality goes down"
"Genshin impact has became worsen day by day, the banner is a joke nowadays no matter how much you spend you don't get what you are spending for. The previous wishing logic was better you spend what you want for, very disappointed @genshin impact, now why should I play when my all hardwork is waste. Thanks genshin for making an good game to worst game."
best game for pc because it looks like a movie because it was using the world
its so lagging i hope you fix the lag and just to make sure its not full storage or not weak internet please fix the lag or it will cause some difficulty in the next update
just perfect
Greates game ever
I like the game very much
this game did not let me play it üò≠ this game is super bad
Very nice graphic design and love his beautiful world
Playing since first version the only important thing that is missing is a skip button for dialogues and conversions based on the players choice and preference also the developers can add an summary version of the texts when clicking the skip button for players to not miss important details Also please check the support teams emails
"so far, you guys kinda flopped in the natlan update. Been a genshin player since inazuma update, sumerus cool, fontaine is amazing, and a half part in natlan is okay...but im confused what kind of theme are you guys going on, im confused. Also, please add a skip button since some of us don't wanna hear constant yapping, idc if it's a part of the lore but some of us are just here for the gameplay. And PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE we lack male characters, kinich was the last five star male."
"game itself is fine, if culturally and racially ignorant, but the team obviously does not gaf about mobile users. i guess the story and game play is fine. it has events, updates and new characters very often. although id rather less new characters and more reruns of older characters and fixing the cryo problem."
i love this game
Start to play again and start to enjoy it once more however.... Some task just impossible to figure out that I always rely on YouTubers
Game is wonderful I'm satisfied how pretty this game is and there's so many characters you can wish for I just really want it to take up less storage
this is always be my favorite game ever
"I'm a STAY and i discovered Genshin Impact from Felix and Chan of Stray Kids so you better collaborate with them Hoyoverse!!! Anyways the game is very beautiful the only thing that quite sucks is the language. As an italian I thought there could be italian, but there wasn't. it's okay because luckily i know english!!üî•üî•"
BEST GAME EVER. SO MUCH DETAILS AND SO MANY AMAZING QUESTS AND CHARACTERS TO MEET AND GET
"Genshin is a great and it characters are so good, but we need characters like Zhongli"
Vrey nice game üéÆ So so good you must play this
"W story, brain torturing questlines that are unskippable and relatively slow regardless i love this game and will always love it"

One of the best game I had ever played in my life
best to play
I love it
The best game from 2021 everything IS SO good 17 Mar.2025 I changed my mind I still love this game but it's not as it was before
"Love the game so much but also hate reading it's story line. So please dear dev add a skip button to the game, please mihoyo listen to your players, just like kuro games did."
pretty good.
Good
so much memories of 2020
big game
I really love this game‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
"i like the graphic, characters, voices and everything. I enjoyed it and if you don't like it I just respect your rate. I like this game.bye"
"Game is awful. Just lazy, ugly and boaring Zelda clone"
I'm going through a glitch... My wish history is not loading... Saying it's an error I have tried uninstalling and reinstalling and repair and all but nothing is working... Please reply hoyo..
good game
I cant play it because it's too big
it's one of the greatest game I ever played but it's to big for android phones
Please do some thing about it that once I opened the game it crashed suddenly on my phone please fix this problem
please add android gamepad support
Just stay away from this game
This is highway robbery at this point. don't let them fool you. You don't win here.
nice
Don't recommend for anyone who's prone to hyperfixation or spending money. Many addicting features that entice fomo. Fun exploration and puzzles
Best game Beter story line i am enjoy the gameüòäüòäüéÆ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è

"My phone is not compatible with this game, I have Infinix smart 9 and I don't know why this game is not compatible with my phone and I hope this get fixed, please support my phone version"
Played for over 2 years. Monney hungry and hates the player base as well as the voice actors. Nothing but a disappointment and dying. Sad but true. So much potential since release and left to die by a company that doesn't care about the people who fell in love with the game. Life improved significantly after deleting. Strongly recommend investing time and effort into a game that's not this one. As a person who used to play all the time I strongly recommend ANY other game. The graphics are pretty
"Excellent üëåüëåüëåüëå I didn't know about this game but bangchan , i.n , Seungmin and felix of straykids play this game often and it is my favourite group so I tried and it came out mind blowing üòäüòä Very excellent graphics and quality üëå"
Pls gimme furinaaaa or kleeee
"I really really love the game, unfortunately I had to delete it because the game's size is huge but the experience that I had with the game was fantastic üòäüòä. Great work üëçüëç with the game. And don't worry I will download the game again when I will buy a new phone, I promise."
Pretty good game but to much space
I like it but I want furina
This game allows us to move freely which I think is perfect but I did found many bugs yet it still gives us The best experience
Genshin impact is amazing . Thank you to the development team for this very good game.
well if this killed your phone like it did mine and even my apple phone just know quest 2 has your back
"Better than most gacha games, as story goes really harder than other gacha games, and of course genshin is original actionwise too"
"still love the lore and story but you guys seem to have forgotten where you stared. this was a mobil game and now it plays horribly on mobil devices. glitchy, slow, lags like no tomorrow. please fix its playability on mobil. i love playing on play station but there are times i dont have access to my ps4 and have to use my phone so yea"
its fun but only a small problem is that i don5 get primo when open chest
Best rpg game on the world
I have login with everything but game is not telling that the account it's working
good graphics and animation üî•üî•
this game is really fun but it does take up a lot of space but the game itself and the story make up for it
I didn't win my 50/50 at 80 I got qiqi >:o
1 because the download response is not speed
This is the best game of my life which I will keep playing all my life ü§ç I'd GAME LIFE
Paimon is a good breakfastüí´
My acc got hacked and you guys have braindead customer support how am I supposed to show you the receipt of that one time purchase of 3 years ago? Even after explained everything carefullt they dont let you get your account back totall cash grab game. I played since 2020 and 5 years woth grinding is no joke. I mentioned everything clearly including exact time and date and every info of the device and the account still just because of that one time purchase receipt from 3 years ago they reject.
"Really nice game.Nice characters,great storyline and lots to explore"
i hate the 2 teams in the abyss like not everyone have 2 teams or can grind for 2 teams
"Buena historia, si te gustan los juegos de aventura y rol, este es para ti. Como mencion√©, tiene muchas cosas positivas as√≠ que ¬øpor qu√© una estrella? Simple, no saben escuchar a su audiencia. El juego no es para que lo disfruten ellos, se supone que es para nosotros y en cuanto a personajes y recompensas, por lo menos a mi, me deben mucho."
Arabic translation for better comprehensive game experience
I LOVE IT SO MUCH!!!!!!!!!
"The game is great, in my opinion of course! the character designs are great, it has a great audio, there's adventure, stories, and fighting involved. I think ages 10+ would love it. there's nothing bad or inappropriate in this game and the plot of the game is great. I just got this game last night and it's already amazing. I've been playing it nonstop. Although the updates take a while to load it's worth it in my opinion!!!"
This is the best game on the mobile But I don't know why Graphic game is low for me but I say it is very good and please continue
i love it the graphics too it's so cool but i don't have friends to play with it but you can play (Genshin Impact) and join me i loved to play with some friends download Genshin
"I love genshin, everything about it, the graphics wow, the characters wow, the gameplay wow, the story WOWWOOWOWOW!!!!!!"
"Best fantasy game it feals like playing a real anime fighting style, character, adventure alot of things to do but i think it should make a multiplayer server so many people join and play i know its hard cause the maintenance of such server and the money required will be alot but i hope u can atleast put a pvp arena in which u can pvp with your friend that would be funso far best game"
everything is good but gasha why i always lost 50/50 i hate it
It is a good
"üëåüèΩ100/100 üëåüèΩ I would like them to make a collaboration with Hing School DXD anime, to play with Rias Gremory."
Absolutely senssional my fav game
a dream game for anime fans.....1st few days it's hard to handle but after that it's easy and enjoyable
it's a best adventures game
no development at all. even new games like wuwa feels better at all of in game aspect
Always been my favorite game
I've resend verifying code many times and type a verifying code to the game but the game told me that code invalid
I had to delete almost every game and app I owned and now I only have YouTube and genshin impact installed but it's worth it even tho the game is 34gb would recommend
need more challenges other than Theatre and spiral abyss. By this it will be more engaging

"Can't reset my account and can't delete it either, and they don't even reply to the emails. I want to either reset my progress from the same acount or delete it. Help genshin"
Great fun
perfect just perfect
it's really fun and everything is good just that it gets really glitchy and then kickes me out of the app
baler game
Zelda BOTW rip-off which so much p2w mechanics.
Very fun
game kikir
Very fun
Love it
"Third time around that I wasted primos but didn't get at least one 5 star character. Kept tossing me 4 star cons when every 4 star character of mine is already almost at c6. Don't give me those cons when I really want the character on the banner please. This is utterly unfair. Also, I bet one of the very reason that majority of the past players doesn't enjoy this game anymore is because it's really hard to acquire primogems for pulling. Only 700 to 1000 per event when pulls require minimum 10k."
best
"The Downloading is split into multiple parts, a little from the play store and then 10s of minutes in app -this is normal, sure. But I've let the app do all it's preparing, and I have yet to successfully even see a menu once since. If it even can load up it takes more time than it does to play a full round of a normal game (including starting up), so what's the point."
IT IS AWESOME!!!! I WAS VERY INTERESTED IN THE GAME
"Como es que el juego se siente igual que la 1.0? no han mejorado nada util. Tremendo bodrio, padre wuwa es superior"
good
"Boring game. It doesn't have p2p, and it's end game is sooo boring. Gatcha boring. Most of the quests are skippable, and unreadable. Not that entertaining. NOT RECOMMENDED FOR CHILDREN, because of the character designs(some)."
"I Love this game, its fun to play and thers alot to do :D"
Best game graphic everything
it's a nice story
"So far, I love Genshin! Once you really get the hang of how everything works, everything else is a piece of cake! The quests are fun too, and levelling up your adventure levels isn't as hard as I thought it would be, but overall, amazing game to play! I'm so glad I found it!"
worst
Not the same feeling it used to be
would be better if they could add something where we can see our finished world quest and story quest
ONE OF THE BEST GAMES I EVER PLAYED!! even though I waited for a few minutes (maybe an hour) just to download this game but was definitely worth it
best story game
"Developers very not player friendly. I pray this game gets good, but for now it's such a bad game in so many aspects."
"I started playing at 4.2-4.3, it motivates me a lot that I can play a RPG combat game. However, as the game progress to 2025, the feedback the players are requesting for QoL Changes didn't even appear and some just random trash QoL. Plus in 5.4, just about 5k Primos for only 50 fates? Compare to Wuwa, which gives us free 5 star at the start. That's the right devoleper I want. No greedness, just listening their feedback. Why can't you be like them? This viewer is now from 4 stars to 2 stars."
Ok
"Solid 4/5, its a great popular game its one of the first ever open world game to be popular, for all the wrong reasons. the fandom is bad and I know they have nothing to do with it, I'm just saying it, Overall I love playing this game thank you hoyo for furina pulls!! I'm a n1 Furina fan"
this game is batter experience for new life advancher and good luck for play this game
"It used to be ""good"", now with Natlan everything went down the drain. (Had a bad feeling abt the future of the game since Fontaine dropped in 4.0, now in almost 5.5 my fears were confirmed.) I doubt Snezhnaya would make me come back to genshin. Maybe Khaenri'ah would change my mind. But that would realistically be in 2 years minimum. Maybe more Abyss related stuff would make me actually want to come back, but all of my hopes went kapoot since the day Natlan dropped."
I really like this game but because of a stupid glitch I can't progress And I also don't want to create another account just for that If you guys can't help me with the problem then I guess I have to quit the game üòû
Addicted to this game.Love it!
I love it
My phn has snapdragon 7 gen 3 and idk what is wrong with the game.. i literally installed it 5 times also the 32gb additional file and I didn't face any problem but when the app starts verification file app crashed every single timee.. i really want to play the game but idk what to do
Dont whitewash them all hoyo.
ITS GOOD
Bast game in open world üåé
"I love it. the lore is ok, but the characters stories..! I feel like the most tragic background story is furina which is also my fave character. the Graphics are ok üëåit can sometimes lag a bit . you need to grind or farm the material characters which is a total pain and takes a lot of time and getting your books for leveling up. and the game makes you have the urge to spend money on the game cuz of all the characters and 50/50s losses. the 5*characters are kinda hard to get, THE PREMOGEMSüò≠"
Very good
this game jsed to be fun grinding was fun but now it changed too many things and grinding become boring the map is also too big
Not better than wuthering waves combat is trash graphics is worse drop rates suck and if your team wipes out you start with half health healers can't heal don't get this get wuthering waves it's superior in every way even though WW drop rates also suck it is still better or don't even get either of the two just buy a playstation with the money you spend on these games to unlock characters and gear you will have much more fun playing harry potter legacy
this is a very bad game
Ever since natlan came out it just feels so boring tbh
"Currently enjoying Natlan! As a player of about 5 years, I am hoping for the addition of a quick clear function to make artifact/talent grinding easier."
"Not fun anymore, it feels like the game is existing for fan service...:("
extraordinary and the game always evolves
"I love this,I'm a huge fan. I love the style and details along with the stories and quests. 10/10"

you guys are goood but... at let's Listen to your players sometimes.

"Genshin will be cherished for many years to come, but man, it had so much potential. An intriguing story, beautiful open-world, memorable characters, strategizing gameplay, and a moving soundtrack. I've been playing since 2.0, and as much as I wanted to stay until the end, it is hard to accept the direction Genshin has gone. Hoyoverse refuses to improve the game, and the community is just as bad. Everyone is either ignorant or ignored. Stay away from this pile of garbage. You've been warned."
"Love the game, but it kept saying failed to connect to network??? I tried playing other games such as mobile legends and my network is working fine, I didn't even experience lag."

"Now I rate it one star cause I tried to go and redeem the new primo gem codes But it says cannot connect to internet BUT I AM CONNECTED TO INTERNET!! I can't even redeem my primos:,ccc Genshin is fun but not fun without primogems sometimes genshin needs to listen to players"

awesome game ‚ÄºÔ∏è
It is fun and good animations
I got what I want üòÅ
MY FAV GAMEE
why the game wont load and it only stuck at loading screen even tho the internet is ok?
"unable to be play because of ""Network error"" even tho i have strong connection i literally sitting besides the wifi router with 1 gbps, and still network error such useless app."
its good dude
üëçüëç
I love this game. I've been playing this for 3 years and that 3 years was worth it!! This is the best game I've played and ever downloaded.
its good
Very good game üî•
the gacha pull is so low .. your luck has to be high to get what you want.. specially the weapon..been playing since 8 months and i cant get any luck in pulling weapons even i used huge amount
I like this game
"I've been playing genshin for 2 years now! This game is amazing!! It's more off better than anime, sorry- I'm I comparing? My bad so anyway each artist have each amazing animations and artworks, artist like me can relate much, it would better off playing in PC for better graphics and better gameplay, It's been 6 years! Hoyoverse is improving more, and more amazing cutscenes,Sceneries, characters and more :3 It is also the most popular game worldwide!! Wanna play genshin? Go on! Explore the lore!"
"Edit: Thank god genshin exist!! Exploration is fun, Open world game, AND GOOD CHARACTER DESIGNS!! thank you for reading this :))"
Great
"To understand the lore you need to read books which makes it boring. The achorn quest is boring, gameplay is ok at best, the equipment need to be grind like crazy for good gameplay. Not fun, boring and very petty when it comes to reward so mid game."
Slow loading and pay to win
game needs forever to load after the updates and is a pay to win as well as impossible to pas certain qusts
Please add SKIP button or else please remove Paimon Dialogue because she only repeats whatever anyone says
I like it üëå The only thing I don't like is how much storage it takesüò≠
Network error Fix It or I leave itüëéüëé
Love it
The game is good and cool but when I try to play I'm stuck in the loading screen and it say no network connection even thought my Internet is very good
absolute garbage
Love this game Zelda vib
fix the opening or loading screen it's not a connection problem everytime I log in it takes 10-20 just to log in the game because of this logging bug in the loading screen
The game is really good imo. I've played for a year and I still find it fun. It does get a bit repetitive once you've done everything but the constant updates keep me engaged. It is a pretty time consuming game and can be overwhelming for new players if you want to do everything so it may not be for everyone. I love all the characters and the scenery is beautiful. it's definitely worth a try if anyone likes open world rpgs. I can see myself still playing this game until the end of it. üòä
"By each day it's becoming more blurry, let's define the ""hentai"" category again. Theres NO NEED to make people addicted to the game via porn the gameplay is already REALLY GOOD. unfortunately every other aspect is bad, power creep, gacha, artifact farming all to hook people to the game, maybe try not doing that and making a good game. The game is good if you wish to play a pricy porn game that has good gameplay if you have money also did I mention that the skill scale is your credit card balance"
I love the game it's amazing ü§©
"It's a mindblowing game that I have ever played , I have attached to this game"
This game is one of the most ridiculous games I've played for 3 years and I saw that this game is evil and now they didn't even bother to hide their names. Even their clothing designs are evil. It really broke my heart.
If your friends recommend to play genshin like mine you are singing a concert with a devil TAKE MY WORD...
"Absolutely love the quality, takes time to load but so worth it"
Best mobile game i have ever played
"Now, this game has gone to waste with repetitive story quests. Weekly Bounties are gone, so making more Mora is difficult (Ley Line doesn't help). The game is now focusing on adding fewer male characters and more female characters. Natlan is a joke of an Archon quest. Officially done with Genshin."
Amazing story and visuals.
"Impressive stories, cool characters and fun events. Fell in love with the game again but phone performance is really poor on 3-4 year old phones"
stop with the compiling shaders it makes my phone laggy üò†üò†üò†
I love the game even when I come back to play it but trying to log in into my account and it said wrong password. I try it multiple time and wonder why it isn't working. Tryjng contacting the customer support no luck. Try reseting my password to my email no code comes in my mail. How far genshin have fall. Made me lost all my progression and characters i enjoy playing. :(
I love this game but you need to play on hardware that can handle very big games
it is perfect game for people who like anime graphics and adventure
gameplay is good but we need skip function
most time wasting game primogen was soo costly and this game forced us to play 20 hours a day and still loose continuously in hard pity.
Love it!
am just a bigenner in this game but I can't stop playing now
"I've played this game since April 2023, I really appreciated the game back then, though it's just different now. I like the characters' lore, but it has more dedication to the fan service, more than the cultures of the countries that the nations are based off of. For example, Natlan. I think it's based off of Spanish, Latin and African cultures, yet it doesn't seem like it. I just wanna complain that you should make the characters represent their culture, though Fontaine is good enough I guess."
"It was such a fun game.The storyline was great, and I just loved the animations and characters! 10/10 would recommend!"
Natlan sucks but the rest is AMAZING. Just wish the devs listened to the global players aswell as china instead of only china.
"this game is just so amazing, I like it very much"
"The game is good but it's creativity about ""copy and paste"" character thing is yküòë, and having too much glitches(though some are rly good.), and a not actually winning 50/50 on wishing, a literal 4* with a 5* animation is crazy, the graphics are good but it really needs other species of the humanoids, having a real 5* chara w/ good lores, making the Archons even more serious plus having many more mysteries, the bosses really needs a more creative design, that's it I hope u read this hoyo, tyüòä"
remove natlan from the game
I love this game but when you get a certain level you won't have alot to do
Can u unhidde P‚Ä¢A‚Ä¢I‚Ä¢M‚Ä¢O‚Ä¢N i mean P‚Ä¢A‚Ä¢I‚Ä¢M‚Ä¢O‚Ä¢N always follow where Character go or Traveller go plls un hidden P‚Ä¢A‚Ä¢I‚Ä¢M‚Ä¢O‚Ä¢N because P‚Ä¢A‚Ä¢I‚Ä¢M‚Ä¢O‚Ä¢N is only showing when chatting and Eating I love P‚Ä¢A‚Ä¢I‚Ä¢M‚Ä¢O‚Ä¢N shes so cute and adorable‚ù§Ô∏è I love himü•∞
This game is so fun! Totally recommend!!
No good qol.. New characters looks mid... Story has worsened... New region looks bad... Exploration qol locked behind certain character... Powecreep getting out of hand... More predatory gacha banners... Less rewards... All things considered this game is really bad... And Im out üëã
my acc can't even back what a waste of time dealing this support system of mihoyo I'm quitting.üò°
"Characters are all disappointing after fontaine release, lacking decent make characters whereas there's too many female characters only for fan service. New characters release so hasty without even trying to get people interest in them, and all character selling point was just appearance with zero meaningful story connection. The story was one of the biggest reason i play this game but now the game is avoiding it like the plague. Typical big company running the game with greeds"

This is a very fantastic game
"Buff the older characters, please. If your other game can do it, then surely this one also can? It's astonishing how an old limited character at C6 could get powercrept by a C0 new released character."
can't wait to play the game
"My account has enter security risk,what should i do? üò≠ Please help meüò≠"

This is my frist time i playing this g and my frist time I play PS4 pro and on my phone and my favorite game i love music and i love go do mission and i love get new players and i love make friends and take to players and go places i love cooking and fight monsters and i has ex i started playing until may last year
This...this has too much storage for my phone...sadly I cannot download this because my storage is almost full...this game's storage is 30+gb...but I did downloaded this game from another device and it's great and just a lil buggy...this deserve to have a 5 star because there is a lot of detail and the graphics is smooth but it's just a little blurry...so...that's it...
Very Gooooooooooooodüíñ
"Beautiful. Poor controls. My Poor Battery! My little phone can't handle it! The battle is over, for me! üòî"
this game is at its downfall. really sad that they dont listen to their players at all.
"Recently I am having this problem where every time I check my banner history it says ""Unable to obtain data. Please check your connection and try again. -(unidentified)"" but I have a good connection"
It a good game and i luv it but my problem is with the login whenever i login to my account i have to change the password again because it keeps saying there a problem but ik that my password is correct i have screenshot but it still says that something is wrong idk if just me because if this keeps happening i would not want to play anymore
ÿ≠ŸÑŸàÿ©
"I played since wanderer rerun. Everything was going great, until the game just gets dull. Before Natlan, everything was so entertaining. Now after Natlan, the game feels like it was made by a different company. There are more female characters than the males. And the fact almost all the characters in Natlan are modernized. Natlan is a traditional looking Nation. The devs are now money hungry, and almost all Nation females are for fan service. Wouldn't play again."
I am a anima lover so best game for meeeee#üòòüòò
This game is amazing guys you should tri this guys I love this game ee
The Dev's should add some end game contents for the players as of now the only end game content is farming artifacts and trying the spiral abyss once every 2 weeks it gets really repetitive and grindy. They should probably remove the resin system as we can only do 4 domains a day( condensed resin) and 8 times without making condensed resin and a way to get primos rather than exploring a specific region for chests. Tip - you get a 4 star every 10 pulls and a 5 star every 90 pulls or early
I love this game
Going with the trend
worst
"1. The Lore 10/10, the story is well planned and well-written, nothing like any cliche boring fantasy. Every line serves a purpose and it's wonderful 2. The visuals and design 8/10. Just stunning. Not a big fan of sexualized characters but good characters. In my opinion, personality first, design is always second 3. Game mechanics and gacha 5/10, The game mechanics are fun and dynamic. But the wishing system is terrible, no guarantee on 4 stars and needs a lot of luck Over all 9/10 game."
"This game is awesome. I mean it's a really good game. But the downloads at the start are a bit too much. They take up most of the time and data to be downloaded. Except this, I think everything is fine."
"As someone who has gotten decently far into the game (AR55) and played around the Inazuma release, I have plenty of experience from this game itself. That being said, all this game is doing currently is going south. The company refuses to listen to valid, useful criticism. End-game content is boring, and rewards simply aren't enough to suffice the gacha system. Resin cap is too small, so farming for characters is tremendously time-consuming, and frankly, their updates fall flat more than less."
It's cool
"This game is fun but it's lost some of it's aspects it previously had, also the fan base toxicity is on another level I love this game but hate the fan base I think someone needs to do something about it because main reasons why I think they aren't taking user feedback is because everything out of the users mouth is toxicity, but I so feel some characters are Abit to over the edge and power crept, I miss the good old days when people always tried pulling for Venti and Zhongli"
Love it
"just one thing for QoL update. ""Genshin will never"""
it is the world's worst game I have seen and played I will give it 0.1 star but there is no option to less than 1 star because they give me limited 5 star only on guaranteed I have many standard character. weathering waves is the best game because they gave many gems
I've loved the game for a long time. It was much fun back then. My experience now is quite disappointing because of the powercreep.
"This Game mechanics Is so details Like You can do the unexpected, So Much things, Cool Fighting Mechanic and animation, Like We can dodge, What we need more than a DODGE. 5/5"
I love this game. It always gives me something to do if I am bored
If you don't want to represent the people don't take the cultural!
"Theres alot thing you can i do and you to!my fav fart when theres new story quest(actuly the new ones only i had done lol)and new place to explore! Only one prob though,when pull alot of free to play players dont have enought primo, but the ress its perfect ."
Natlan kinda flop but ofc the gameplay still decent
U get baddies
good
Hoyoverse Pls make it so that you can co op in spiral abyss üò≠ 301mb but its actually 32gb
The game has gone under some positive changes on the past months so from 1 star I raise it to 2 stars. hopefully we will see even more positive changes.

"nice storylines, nice art styles. but the new nation natlan is so bad. the previous ones were enchanting, but after fontain it downfalled so bad. Also, Natlan characters are supposed to be brown, right? Even now, they sexualize characters more."
Boooooo
I can't even download this game as it requires massive amount of storage. The game updates literally took over 30% of my phone storage.
"Out of the last 15 or so 5 stars 14 have been female and almost all of them have had mediocre designs since about Natlan to top it all off. I fear Hoyoverse is pandering to a weird audience that is only interested in male self insert content and female character fan service instead of actual story / lore and it's honestly just cringe at this point. If every second female character you meet in events previously hinted at having a crush on the mc, you've overplayed your cards, genuinely."
the gameplay and style is very good. the story they added is getting better and better! I just wish they weren't so stingy on the rewards
super game
This game is 90% blah blah!
I love this game cuz of the graphics and fighting and chiori :)

I enjoy this game
"Fontaine was good, but the lore fell apart in Natlan. I don't even need to talk about how monotonous the game can become because of endless dialogues and repetitive puzzles. In addition to few endgames."
stay away as far as you can.Game is good but horrible interface and customer support
3 YEARS FOR 3 WISHES GIVE US BETTER AWARDS FOR E.G :20000 PRIMO TREAT UR PLAYERS.
Most epic game ever
The game is very cool and I loveeee venti
I couldn't get in and I got my account frozen for 20 minutes I'm never playing genshin impact ever again
male to female 5 stars lack balance
"Bad game, because every enemy and boss is very difficult to kill"
Did y'all lost braincells after creating sumeru and fountain?
"I used to be addicted to Honkai: Star rail, but now, to cure my addiction I have decided to play Genshin. I'm giving it 5 stars because the star rating is pretty low right now. Also you should add a feature where we can fight Paimon."
üí´woww
"From 5 to 3 now to 1 star. Natlan is straight up the most boring region on the entire game. Not only the story is more childish, character and map design philosophy also has changed...making the game felt goofier instead of its old action-rpg element. And after almost 5 years, only now they're adding controller support. Tf they've been smokin for 5 years? A lot of basic QoL features are still missing like skip dialogue option, customizable UI, etc but they have time for features no one ask for"
KIKIR IMPACT
lmao one day y'all will care enough to stop screwing up the game lmao
Very fun üëç
Very good but if you let us know which character is more power than the other.
Natlans really good
"I play this game everyday, I can say the three only bad things of this game are: 1. Little girls as a character üòß 2. Female m0ans (a lot of, why?) 3. Too much text."
Losing your 50/50 to a characters that you hate sucks!
Nice
this game is fun to play and very interesting story characters and etc.
The game is great with many interesting things to do. It's fun to play too.
Genshin is the best game l have ever played üòÄ
5 star for me
I don't like the way to get primogems cuz is 100x harder than the other games like zzz and honkai (i don't have the motivation to grind that much)
Wow it took like 2 hours of downloading and after that i need to wait 1-2 more hours wow good game keep it up
"After 5.0, everything changed. As great as Fountain was, Natlan is just as bad"
kinda dont like their pull ing system give you stress
Good
cool
It's cool but take so mush space in my phone
"nah, i will just play wuthering waves"
"makin kesini makin kyk bkp, minim cowo trs di natlan udah ah ga cocok bgtüôÑüôÑ"
Game yang sangat bagus minesnya kasih sembako dicicil
"It is super fun, and I love the characters and the animations, too. The voices are also amazing. The quests are also pretty easy, but some are challenging. I really love it. I recommend playing jt"
Pity system sucks. I only win 1/5 50/50's. If capturing radiance didn't wxist then i will never win 50/50
"THIS GAME IS TOO HARD FOR ME TO BEAT LIKE FLOOR 4 OF THE ABYSS ORDER IS TOO HARD AND IF I LEVEL UP MY CHARACTER NOTHING CHANGES THE ENEMIES WILL JUST BE STRONGER THIS GAME IS SO UNFAIR ALSO IM HAVING DIFFICULT TIME WITH THE GATCHA 90 PULLS IS TOO MUCH I GIVE UP ON THIS GAME!,"
Good
"Good game, but I've just fallen out of love with it. New update patches feel lazy and it feels like the game is cycling into a predictable pattern with tidbits of good story here and there. Hope they try something different moving ahead that freshens up the game"
It's good for adventure
Best game in mobile
"KIAMBU....neat RPG and like the feature to block/mute out others....RPG's are meant to play (SOLO)!!! KIAMBU has the best wind gang...including XIAO...TRIPLE CROWNED C6 61.9/291% crit, 2403 atk....and KAZUHA TRIPLE CROWNED C6 with 50.1/237% crit and 2505 atk!!! [FEEL THE POWER OF KIAMBU]"

Great game with lots of fun characters. Amazing when it comes with the diversity of the game and it's contents.
"As a player who almost played this game for a year, I'd have to say it's pretty great.! Overall the gameplay is dinamic and there's variety of regions. Just one thing, maybe chest rewards for explorations should be more rewarding. And that's it! Great game üê§"
Good üëåüëå
Pretty good
this game is good it's an open world the problem is the compiling shaders is super slow and too much dialog and it's the worst each update of 64mb in the end nothing happened what's the purpose?
I lost my 50-50 üò°
I love it but I get lost all the time and have no clue what I should do
Add a skip button plz it take alot of time to complete quest due to the cutscenes

"Inazuma story quest is damn disappointing, i just beat the god and then the story ends with nothing. Not even a single reunion or farewell from the traveller friends. Hate it."
"it so slow to get email verification code when i have to use the same account on the new device yeah...its failed to get the code, howw??this is frustrating üò§"
I keep deleting and downloading it cause I both love and kinda hate it. It's cause of the storage. But still a five star

"No endgame, easy mobs, literally nothing to use my characters that I built on because everything dies in 20 seconds. UPDATE: there's some endgame but ever since they stopped releasing male characters I've stopped playing, clearly i am not the kind of fan hoyoverse wants. nothing wrong with only waifus but i wish they didn't pull the rug out from under us and just started with only girls from the very beginning so i would not to bother with this game"

Fun game but it won't let me log back in üò≠ would be four but the community is so freaky and character designs are really sus. In for people who rated this game one star because they didn't get some stupid character design that was just a rumor you're a dumbo.
Only no life users play this game
"Honestly, the game is good and better than what the community says, I prefer it than wuwa cause the exploration is fairly challenging. Good graphics, best elemental reactions, good stories. The community became very toxic, they all want stuff to help them consume less time, but for me, it's fine this way. Continue with the good works devs -bananaba"
"This is an amazing game and i absolutely LOVE it, but I wish there were more male characters and different body types (instead of everyone being so thin). I also wish it was a lot easier to get primogems (since I'm an F2P player) because there are so many adorable characters."
why ios support controller but not android? add controller support and I'll 5 star
"Excellent game and all, but should be the controller option available on Android tablets as well. PLEASE ADD THIS OPTION."
Best android game
Please add voice over to world quests also.
I like it thus far. I just really wanna play with my friend soon.
boring asf
"With how the storyline is going, I propably will not play till the end. Am currently only interested in the khaenri'ah lore, but prob just watching the lore from youtube and not play."
It's a great game! And I really love it but it's hard to get primos at some point maybe more chances for it^^
In love with it.
"I've liked he game up until now. All Genshin wants us to do it spend money. I am a TEENAGER. That only played this game for fun and to pass time. It's a really good and interesting game overall. but the way you have to level up and make your characters stronger is making me mad, it's hard getting good artifacts because its like your gambling, all I ever get when levelling up artifacts is either elemental mastery, HP, Or defense. And my character keep getting weaker every time. It's maddening."
It's a really great game and the plot is getting better and better by the updates. I have been playing it for a year now and I still didn't get bored once.. It's only problem is that it takes a lot of storage for Mobil players but you can still delete some of the data from the game which is really helpful. I would recommend this game for people who really like exploring and RPG.
"I can't chat on the chat page, what's the reason?"
Best Game
I just enjoy suffering
For a game this content is for a loser's
"This is great so far, but... I want more male characters. The new characters you guys add are always girls, and I really love this game, cuz I met someone there, thanks"
Best game
Very interesting game
"fr the best gacha game ever best graphics, story, lore, characters everything is just great"
Game crashes on compiling shaders everytime
It's all good until Da Wei took over and decide to make Natlan (especially the characters) into gooner slob.
Look this game Is not that bad but I wished is had skip button and after long time I come and my EVERYTHING is was gone!
the game graphics are not the same as Cloud Genshin has!
"PLEASE QUICKLY RELEASE THE CHARACTER NAMED ""COLUMBINA"" and my life is yoursss"
I like dis game
"If I have to explain this game in one word, I'll say (peace,) üôÇüòå"
Insane level of optimization and the best RPG I have played in mobile
Good
"Perfect storyline (especially Fontaine), which makes it so interesting. And the gacha system is awesome. I recommend this to anyoneüëçüëçüî•"
I really enjoy playing it on my free time the stories and charter's are truly beautiful
Pretty smooth game for a dimensity 8 series
"The devs of this game will never listen to it's players. I have spent too much money on this game. For what, a disappointment of Natlan, its paid exploration, a mid story, mid characters and NO QUALITY OF LIFE. I used to love this game but look what the fanbase and incompetence has done to my boy. DON'T SPEND MONEY ON THIS GAME I IMPLORE YOU."
from best to worst game because of thier devs all I ask for in this stupid game is a cutscene skip option
Uninstall it as no controller support for andriod....why only controller support for ios??? Too troublesome to download n set up 3rd party controller .....
Nice game
Best game ever
No capping it is good
"Iove the game, but one star just for using ai voices"
It's worth it to spend all my money love this game but it's starting to get boring with these new updates and characters as cute as they are it just isn't as fun as it was before
I can't login because of the verification process. You keep sending me the codes 5 MINUTES LATE SO I CANNOT ENTER THE RIGHT CODE. PLEASE FIX THIS.
The best game in my Life
"Lore is actually good,but storytelling is not that great.But the game has improved a lot than before"
"Not sure if it can further optimise for phones with old processors like the Snapdragon 685 but regardless I enjoyed the game even though it heats up my phone. There's a lot to do, if you're new to open world and anime games give this one a try."
I love it
boring
"All i can say is, this game is so fantastico!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!"
"My comfort game, I'm glad a open world game like this is free. Unbelievable."
"My review was from 2022 as u can tell and now I'm editing this. I usually say that ""I will nvr quit this game bc it's the best game of all time"" but not only I'm bored but since chiori banner, I completely lost interest. I can't believe I whale in this game it was one of the regretful decision. The gameplay and systems are now sucks. Sumera was fixed because of Fontaine and Natlan is doomed. The more we play the more harder it gets. Do not download this game"
I liked it
I luv it!
"The lack of Cool masculine Male characters really bothers me, Way to much fan service and female characters."
"Two stars is the fairest grade I can give this. The main story is ok, but marred by poor presentation and needless exposition that a skip button is needed. Hoyoverse refuses to innovate, often giving meaningless QoL updates. Day 1 issues like timegated domains, expensive late game farm, lack of rewards, event FOMO (some with IMPORTANT character lore), no artifact loadouts, and exploration powercreep remain. Community is also too complacent to hope for change. Music is good. Overall, would avoid."
Still no QOL in 2025 compare to other gachas. Not F2P. If you want to be play this just play other gachas.
Very good
kelia banget
Can't download it in laptop had issues with disk and volume but have beautiful character and graphics and smooth movement good story line
Really good graphics
Its realy good app I injoy from this app
Fun
It have a very good game story .I like this
"After 5 years we are just getting a mail serach option instead of Artifacts loadouts and the domains are still gated on specific days, i give up on genshin, i will now buy subscription in wuthering waves."
It's like playing a real video game.
Just needs a bit of adjustments with controls
I didn't even get to play it because it took sooo long to just load!!!
I love to playing games üòçüòé it's very cool and enjoying.
This game is....the most beautiful graphics I've ever see
Very good love it
"Shall I give you advice, You should at least play the game for the story mode."
Very good and cool
"Devs don't listen, and they used AI üíÄüíÄ"
"Used to be 5*, but I cannot in good conscience continue playing HoYoVerse games since they've recently started replacing voice actors in ZZZ due to the strike."
I wish there was more focus on representation.
good game and good story line
I'm just an npc but it's good
I keep losing my 50/50 on a character I want and it keeps shutting me put of the app when I try to login with my chromebook
"add a skip button for the love of God. make co-op events optional and reward-free. you're servers are bad, it's a fact. no one is complaining but at least don't make my experience horrible because of it. in co-op events as person whom constantly has 180+ ping I'm at disadvantage. it's take the fun out of it, and I still have to do it if I want the rewards. so please make the event rewards based on a single target measure. and make co-op for people who can actually enjoy it."
thank you hoyo‚ù§Ô∏è
It was a great game but the new characters really have big fan service. We need nore characters like those characters in Fontaine or even sumeru. We need more great designs and male characters because Genshin is getting boring. Or at least get help from Honkai star rail designers or even Genshin OCs! And it would be better if you could switch between the twins or even a skip button and collecting primo is so annoying for F2P
"Good Graphics, And The Story Line is just Awesome!!"
"The game takes lots of storage but otherwsise it is fun to play, the designs are creative and I love the story and Cutseneces too!"
"Great game! Recommended it to all of my friends, the music/scenery/story and most importantly the characters are all so good! Hope to see more of the updates!"
"If you are content with a mundane life this game is made for you (review from a day 1 player) Outside of the main story, this game is an absolute drag. This is a 16+GB game and your daily gameplay is just 5 mins of spam clicking the attack and skip button, this game will actively punish you for not playing every single day. The endgame is PATHETIC you will see yourself doing the exact same things over and over again. And when they release new zones YOURE STILL GOING TO BE DOING THE SAME THINGS"
genshin is great EDIT; nahida is my favvv EDIT PT 2: neuviletee is my new fav grinding for him YAS <3
Fix natlan please üò¨
Almost fall asleep during sumeru archon quest. Add skip button for story please. Not all people playing this game for the story

"I've had a great time playing the game over the last few months, but the bizarre lack of voices for half of characters is really hurting the whole experience. It's really gross that a wildly successful company like HoYo would screw over the voice actors AND the game players just so that their execs can make even more money. Pay your workers!!!"
Very good game i like it
I just love the environment of this game. Just refreshing even the story and progress updates of the games are good.
it's good
i like playing genshin. It's fun and I love exploring the nations for primogems. I also love the animation
Nice game üòç
No skip button?????????????????????
Supper in redmagic 10 pro
"Ever since I started playing this game earlier this week, I have been hooked. Beautiful graphics, able to unlock characters, go on missions, and even glide using a glider when jumping from high places. Definitely recommend this game if you love anime and crisp graphics."
character farming is too hard. stopped playing since the release of sumeru. this game is not kind to new players and it will only get worse from here. I might check it out again when the ice nation drops.
Takes too much space
If you have money you'll enjoy this but If you don't you need to woerk hard for it and the dev don't listen to players and all the players are all so weird
Beautiful
"with all the characters and weapons in the game now there is no reason for them to be as greedy with summoning as they are, you will never get anything before pity with the rates, might as well not even be a chance to."
Good
Nice Game
beautiful graphic and interesting game üòÅ
Used to love this game before Natlan. The story as well as the character designs have gotten increasingly worse. There's also been an insane increase in fanservice
"Natlan totally RUINED the whole plot. I loves genshin, I really did but... I really can't stand it rn..."
Initially I was a genshin impact player but hoyoverse is Not giving enough rewards (primogems) like wuthering waves
Just okay
Old game trying to survive but didn't want to hear their players.
"Quite fun in gameplay, Play for freemogemsüòÖ"
üëç
"I really love this game... Whenever I play this game I peacefully walk around and building in teapot, this is basically my inner peace. Thanks for making such a beautiful, breathtaking game.. You really hit my peace ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è"
MY FAVOURITE CHARACTER IN YELAN PLEASE WRITTEN IN SPINING MY REQUEST
SUKAAA BANGETTTT. developernya pelit sih tapi ya yaudah
good game
Good
"I am very grateful to this game because I got many friends from various countries, but the only drawback is that the size is too big, maybe it could be made smaller"
"When I play this game I have so much fun because of the perfection of this game like graphic, characters, story like all of them is so perfect"
It's like very best in the best game of the world and for Android Phone
Love this game been playing for 2-3yrs now and been fun with friends
·êØE·ñáY ·êØE·ñáY GOO·ó™ good game
It's disappointing that I cannot use any coupons with google on this game because I started playing it on my Playstation before mobile. EPIC has cross pay. Can u guys work on that so I can give u more money? Love the game though! My all time fav besides FFXIV. So chill and relaxing but fun and intense when u want to go do more challenging things.
"That is agood game but Something is not visually correctly, sometimes laggy,and I am using many wishes but not found any 5 star even 4 ‚≠ê characters please do something ü•∫..... please"
It's such a fun game. I recommend it. especially if you like story games.
üëç
Genshin haters trying hard to review bomb but still the game is always on TOP 5 of top grossing games. And never goes down from the TOP 10 gacha revenue!!!!!
Excellent
I love this game
This is very great game
ZOOOO WEEEE I LOVE THE CHARACTERS
"I love the graphics, the way how it plays. Instructions are all over it. It's so easy to play. I lovin' it !"
Verryyyyyyy good game üéØüòòüòòüòò
With the release of natlan the abyss or other end game modes became so restricted in which we need to use natlan chars for finishing it 'cause of the nightsoul buff and etc. Which we find it hard for us other players who had limited natlan chars. Also the powercreep in this game became bad because of the outdated chars being not being benefitted by it. So please fix it and make this game a well balanced again just like the old times.
Literally my comfort game <33
Good game but pity lose system should have some changes like when we lose we can get atleast a standard banner character like keqing Or diluc i always get dehya and i hate it even qiqi is better then dehya
I really wanted to play this game but it takes up a lot of storage so I couldn't play it and it takes up a lot of MB. I really wanted to play this game but I don't have the means. üòÖüòÖüòÖ
Not enough tall man in game. Hoyo have been releasing a lot of women
It is a cool game I have ever experienced üòôüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉüòÉ
‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
I love this fckng game but please add SKIP STORY BUTTON
"Love the graphics and all, GREAT storyline but AAAAGHHH!! It's so frustrating that I need so much space to download all the files and stuff, I had to resort to the cloud version but if there was a way to SOMEHOW make file downloading not take around 40 GB I'd probably come back :) Overall I love Genshin and I recommended to my friends :)"
gooner game
Capitano died after barely any screentime and not playable any time soon. Natlan designs are very jarring and lack the visual cultural cohesion present in previous regions. Very disappointing.
Best adventure games in my mobile life
ÿßÿ≠ŸÑŸâ ŸÑÿπÿ®Ÿá ÿ®ÿßŸÑŸÉŸàŸÜüò†
"This game is overall nice and creative in there own way, like finding chest to obtain primo, but still it's over all great it's great for adventuring story, is still processing, some sad, mysterious and exiting yet,here I am still waiting for the story to unfold and to see my sister or brother (whenever u pick as a character) ty HoYoverse such a nice elemental game!, but pls put more chest around we might emty the whole map claiming chest :3"
Great just great
Very good and engaging game
THE BEST GAME EVER! ü´°
I played this because my sister recommend me this game but my heart drop when the GB is so high. But it's really good. I love it
I write this one star because It told me to delete all of my games And this game glitches a little
You get a 4 because the fandom is bad most people are gooners and u only get 4 because you created my will to live for Kinich
"Genshin Impact is an incredible game that combines a rich and immersive world with engaging gameplay. The open-world exploration is vast and beautiful, and the character designs are vibrant and unique. The combat system is smooth and strategic, and the progression system is satisfying and rewarding. The story is also intriguing and well-written, with plenty of twists and turns to keep players invested and is sure to keep you entertained for hours on end!"
I love this game so much it's so fun and action packed to play
Idk what to say but if I do not get wanderer I may quit for 8 days
The banner system is totally unfair How can I lose the 50/50 4 times in a row with hard pity while another win only with 10 draws ?
"The character designs lack any creativity, so the game has turned into a gooner cash grab. They struggle to even have gender equality, let alone have a diverse cast. The game had promise in year one, but has went downhill and has just become predatory in every aspect. They've let greed get in the way of making the game enjoyable (take exploration into account). Wuthering Waves gives you mechanics for free that Genshin locks behind hundreds of dollars."

There in game please improve co-op mode why can just play in domains and only can kill bosses please with friends please improve co-op mode
"This game only brings me disappointments to be honest, ever since Yae Miko's release I was expecting an agressive gameplay but what it was so lame, devs kinda has zero knowledge on how to make a good character kits I swear, and Furina too, and about Mavuika... I have no words, just pure disappointment. Edit: oh really? y'all listen to feedbacks? that's a news to meüòÇ yall never even put artifact loadouts and just made that filtering system instead that doesn't even help, this game is sinking"
So great and nice story
It it really fun and magical like literally started yesterday and already love it
Amazing one of my ochini games
It's good game but takes long to download
Cringe P2w
Wonderful graphics
Absolutely enjoyable!!!
The reason my tablet combusted.
"No qol, no review"
"I love it this game, but be fix the artifacts domain, all i farmed is very trash for almost 3 months. I edited my rate from 5 stars to 1 stars."
Games in impact I am your big fan but you have to do anything when we do loss a 50/50 we need to choose a character please add this in a game Thank you
The graphics are unstable üíó
the game play is really fun because like you have a weaker setup it is really fun to fight bosses but I hope I get forena if I do will be happy so I can kill bosses a lot easier to kill bosses and have fun üòÅ I love it so far
"Why dose everything change badly? I loved the game,but.....they are ignoring us badly because some of my friends are saying they do not like how. You guys are not telling us what is happening with the FTC whatever u did is now making me angry because to be honest not to be mean but the game is kinda bad and I need to be honest I might leave at version 5.7 or sooner and it is funny because a card game is doing better than a rpg open world game wow you should really do better."
Cool
It is a game for 6 years old children . With babies character and anoying and endless discussion .
much more I love this game
I love this game but the download always took very long üòëthe download took like an one and a half hour üòë
Best Graphics 30GB game size OMG üò≥üò±
Best game ever for mobile
Good
Best game
downgrade

Unable to log in with facebook plz solve this problem
Great
My id linked to google account and it was automatically deleted I want it back but now problem solved
"After 5.0 update the Capturing radiance are the most useless update so far , whyyyy ? imagine you have 300 fate and you thought you will get atleast 2 constellation and 1 weapon the same banner but after capturing radiance announce the genshin impact are really bad"
noice game
"Genshin is game that is literally monetization. exploration of this game is so bad and the QOL updates are lock behind premium character unlike the free glider that is give on the start of the game there are no QOL after that. This a multi-billion dollar company but they can't even afford to fix glitches that are still on the game despite being 6 years on service and already bathing on a pool of money they still cannot afford to fix the game, at this point make this a premium whale's game."
"this game has so much potential, its so pretty and i love the artstyle and the music. but theres so many issues i just cant continue playing it this game has a huge problem with cultural appropriation and colorism. i just cannot keep playing because of this. you cannot disrespect other peoples cultures like that :/"
◊ó◊ó◊ó
"I used to really love this game man. Back during COVID time 2021 and 2022. I played this game all day and all night. I would literally love to build my characters, play with the characters and play through the story and I would always encourage other people to play this game. Nowadays my enthusiasm for this game has dwindled greatly. ""THEY DON'T LISTEN"" It pains me to say it but they don't care like how I thought they did and it's only going downhill for them. The only saving grace is the story."
"The game is really good with good effects and tons of characters to collect and an interactive story between the bond of siblings . The only think which I would like the developer to change is the game files and it's storage for mobile players, it takes alot of storage."

I like this game now so much when I downloaded it first and in game download I saw 30 gb and I get angry and thought this is useless but I still let it download because I want to try it it actually feels I'm playing pc game on mobile and I also like the storyline and I want thanks to developers i want to say special thanks to them because I like this game really now I get it why this game is worth 30 gb
It is so Good
Loved it
Very nice
Wow this game is absolutely great even though it's a gacha game but idk man i love the story The story make me cried so hard Like how did they place the story like this It's absolute cinema My favourite Archon quest is Fontain archon quest Who will have thought that furina is working so hard she need to rest NOWWWWWWWWWW
Best game I ever play
I love this game a lot. But it just takes way too long to open the game and if you let it on background the progress of opening the game resets. So I'll just wait until I get a computer again
Good game
Nice game
"Was a favourite game for the last 3 years but since Natlan I barely find the motivation to log in for the events let alone daily. The only character and story I cared about was Capitano, he was so interesting but at last just a small part of the story. I expected some cool historical warland with epic African mythology, instead we got some hiphop ""hello fellow kids"" stuff. Even the new characters from the old regions don't feel like they belong."
Love this game!!!
"I've been wanting to wishes to download this game, now I've downloaded it. But since I'd download this game, my data was suddenly ran out and I can't use it anymore. I have to use hotspot and WIFI, but for my opinion, you should added the other download recourse mention, which is mean download half if the data game, so the storage data won't ran out too much, and if the download recourse was incomplete, try to save the data that have been recently downloaded, so it won't waste the previous one."
Excellent game
Amazing is on of the many words I can think of!!!!
Cool
I like this game but I can't understand English too much
"Epitomized path is a bad idea - Forcing others to spend with a double 50-50 to deal with is pretty money-grubbing, unlike HSR, Zenless and even WuWa which gives you a lot more choice to decide which 50-50 you want to gamble on. I've been playing since launch and been a spender...Sad that this is forcing me to seriously consider going f2p for real, considering how much more story there is to go."
Love this
Loading ko thoda kam kar lete to achha hota meri Hindi samajh mein a Rahi hai Tum logon Ko üò≠ abhi loading hi kar raha hun do loading bhi mat rakho
Event are just pay to win. You can't do anything as free to play
Love it üíñüòå
This is so cool
Good
Just give us better anniversary rewards üôÇ
"such a fan service game, it's not the same as before disappointed"
Nothing new.
Extremely good game but it takes a lot of storage. I want to some feedback that they should reduce the storage that it takes.
this is so beautiful game in my life üòòüòòüòò
Loveit
Love it
best game I've ever played
After wishing on any banner wish count updating getting late it takes so much time
bored on 90 lvl team. just a red eyes
GOOD
"Gacha game. 1000+ days in genshin, hence long-term review. There's not much left in this game. New QOL and game mechanics are not fun and locked behind regions. The dev sure are listening to their player üòí. Reruns & banner system is better in HSR than genshin. If you're a new player, you can skip this game."
"Maybe less to download, my game ended up crashing almost every time I opened the app"
"A lot of loyal Genshin players are bisexual if not bicurious. And there are women players too. So having only 2 male character in Natlan, that being Kinich and Ororon, is the reason why you are losing money over love and deepspace. Handsome guys with good bod is just as beautiful as women like Mavuika. BALANCE. IT. OUT."
Nice game
"I would give it a 5, but i wish there was an offline mode or something, because sometimes when i'm travelling i have unstable/mo internet and i cant play for a week or more which is annoying when i have the daily reward gamepass thing."
Best mobile game of my life.
Can't capture the otters in nets to put in my teapot 0/10 do better
"Stories and quests have too many words in it. The writing team make it so bad I wanna throw hands everytime I do quest. They're literally a firm believer of ""telling"", instead of ""showing"". They don't make Paimon shut up. And I'm not even start about the substance of the story. It's so VERY SHALLOW like it was written for kids. Like 7-12 year-olds. The reasoning behind the story is dumb. The critical thinking in the solution making is dumb. The motive of every character is one dimensional."
Terimakasih hoyoverse telah membuat game sebagus ini
Love ittt
Words cant work with this one
"Farming artifacts are pretty disappointing, it's almost like you have a job that would last for so long until you get your salary that's actually good‚Äî There should be an uprade in it ngl"
"Nice graphics and gameplay but quit because cannot play using my Razer Kishi v2 pro, and cannot transfer to other server even if wanna pay for transfer. Have spent much money on the characters warp and could have more but they are not working on these issues."

I don't know what to say about this game because it's really cool
I don't have installed on my phone simply because of storage space but I do have it on PS5 it is the best game I have played so far
THE GAME IS TO GOOD ‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π
the game is good but i hope they put the feature to change the main characters gender since some players wanting to switch to the other twin
awful game direction lmao
"Every time I login, the landscape keeps changing. Everything is bigger, the hills, cliffs, boulders, squirrels, the flowers, mushrooms etc while the characters keep getting smaller. It takes me longer to get to places & my characters run out of stigma faster, making it harder to do delivery quests or just climbing cliffs/walls. The other issue my characters are not dodging attacks. I don't know if it's a glitch but they're moving slower. There's a glitch on liyue that screen freezes."
"Lmao claim gift birthday aja harus tepat di hari itu.

Love the gameee
This game very interesting and this mi favourite game and i love this game very much üí≠üí≠üí≠üí≠üí≠üí≠üí≠üí≠
A cool adventure game to play with friends in coop üòé totally five star
"So tired of this game, devs don't even listen to players"
It was a good experience
It's alr ig too much yapping tho.
Epic
"Best game for mobile and anime rpg lovers, every one try once"
miss the time when it was fun
"Here's my situation... I've played this game before, (Great game btw). Deleted it for storage. Got a NEW phone. Tried to log in with the same Gmail account. Said I have to enter a code that they sent to my said Gmail. I find it, then enter it. (Honesty I've done this too many times to count) and it says it's INVALID!!? Please fix this!! I like this game a lott!!"
üëç
"THIS IS FUNNY ANYMORE. BRO I'VE BEEN STUCK ON THAT STUPID CLOCK PUZZLE, IT HAS BEEN A YEAR ALREADY AND NOT A SINGLE PROGRESS TO UNLOCK ROOMS, WHO TF EVEN THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD IDEA TO ADD THAT INTO THE GAME. NOTHING LITERALLY HELPS. WHOEVER THOUGHT IT WAS A GOOD IDEA SHOULD GET FIRED."
This game is amazing. However some quests are easy to miss due to being distracted by other things. For example the Ascension quest. For a long time I was stuck due to my AR not increasing. It wasn't until I found out a friend of mine also played and was way ahead of me. I gave her access to my account so she could find the problem and hear I learned about the Ascension quest.
"Brain dead mobile cash grab garbage game, soon they charge you to walk in game. Imagine not having controller support on a game like this, Wuthering Waves works with controller no problems. Just find more a more ways to scam your player and don't improve the game that the Hoyoverse way."
Seru gamenya bikin nagih apalagi ada temenku yang asik yang bisa mabar samaku pokoknya the best dah game ini
Wow just wow
Need Free Primogem!!!
PRIMOGEMSSSSSSS
I got 10 pulls and got the new characters of Natlan. and the character of Fontaine!
It's so good
"hello!i downloaded this game 6 months ago it didn't disappoint me i love the game so much but the player/fandom is another thing,i found the players of this game ""wierd""and dumb maybe?? because i see so many ship that literally dont make sense and how the players complain or hate anything,but i don't gaf about that tho jus wanna say i like this game,so I'll give it a 5 star reviewüëç"
this game is not fun at all the high ping approach everytime we find boss and entering domains do still updating this game? do you have a maintenance for better experience lag issues did not fix how can we enjoy to play my ping in other game is below 50ms but in this game 120ms? 230ms? 990ms? is this have a maintenance? or this game can fix the lag issues? if you can fix that issue please do it some of my classmates delete the app because of lag and server issues hope you fix lag issue thank you
Really dislike the direction it has taken recently.
Stupid power creep
Just like anime cool
Best game ever played
Nice but my mobile is Slow üòî
Good game
It takes long to log in
"This game is very exciting and interesting, usually when I have a lot of problems I play this game and immediately feel calmer‡´Æ‚ÇçÀ∂·µî ·µï ·µîÀ∂ ‚Çé·Éê ‚ÄºÔ∏è, the point is i like this game"
bad game.
Please add a skip button
"It became extremely boring ever since 5.0 patch came out The peak was Natlan and Fontaine - at everything tbh. Gameplay, character design, world, mechanics, story - everything. And now? What is this...? Over sexualised characters that looks so out of the game (like bro, a mf motorcycle...!?)(ther're so many cultures that could've been used but no.), world that's hard to explore without the natlan characters, boring story quest that's basically ""friendship is magic"" Really disappointing..."
"halo hoyo, akun hoyoverse ku habis kena hack, jadi data game genshin ku dan semua game hoyo ku hilang, tapi ada beberapa game yang bisa masuk lewat google, tapi pas mau ganti email ternyata email nya uda milik si hacker, aku mau ganti email nya jadi gabisa, gmn ni"
Nice storyline
"I'm a 1.2 player and Natlan is complete garbage. The world building and its designs clash horribly with the previous regions of the game. The lack of new male 5* characters is also concerning. It would've been fine if the male to female ratio was something like 1:2 or even 1:3, but the last male character banner was literally last year. I am aware of the gender war occuring in online spaces, but alienating half of your audience just to listen to a loud minority isn't the way to go."
This game was great. It help me feel entertain and the characters design is really good but the fandom is bad not all of it but yeah I suggest you play this game if you interested at a story telling game
"It is a great game with an open world map that you can explore various terrains and dimensions. The characters are well designed, the abilities has detailed effects and the graphics is highly very detailed and realistic looking! But there is an only problem, the in game resources takes so much space and storage. Overall, this is a solid 4/5!"
This game has been so fun! I just started playing and I got hooked! The graphics and story are amazing! Overall 10/10 (in my opinion)
Aint no way they added someone named Tupac. 4 stars cuz I lost my 50/50 on diluc
Bad game lower divice player 31gb
I love it
best story line game
I like it so much
Fantastic game
Best game
"Was playing this game after Sumeru dropped, the game went better and better but after 5.0 it became absolutely rubbish. I still kept playing thinking it would get better but no it only went down, the story, the new character designs, world building, landscape everything felt like a big letdown. I would request developers to pls fix the game and character designs in coming updates."
Nice üíØ
It's a great game
Very good game
Changed post to 3*. Still hard to get good heroes especially 5* heroes.
Nice game
"It's a great game but it does have it's downfall with being repetitive. The gacha system, though it's free, is also a huge pain especially when you only get roughly two to three weeks in between special banners. I had recently got back into this game and went from Sumeru all the way through Natlan. It's still a very good game but the dialogue and gacha system needs fixed."
"Natlan made me embarrassed to tell others I play the game. Its environment, story telling, and music is good but the characters lack so much especially in their designs and the refusal to properly represent them. I was gonna ignore it because I thought there was a excuse, but I talked to Six-Fingered Jos√© in a replay and i think thats what made me realize the natlans characters are all lame üíÄ i dont know, it just made me lost interest and feel distasteful for it. Even mizuki"
"Haven't played the game in years. Wanted to come back and play but whenever I try to login it needs a verification code, and every time the code gets sent to my email and I put it in, it says its already expired. Wow I'm glad I left this game years ago because it's so trash."
Nice but you can change the app icon into the letter G.I with a background of the map one star minus for app icon
Awesome
"The game is really boring at the end game and the anniversary really dissapointing. Resin system is just really bad, it took to long to refill and we need LOTS of them to just build one character. They made billions of USD but vety stingy and doesn't care about their players"
"Its a good adventurous and fun game, but on Asia server since lantern rite event I saved up 75 pulls. Even more than that actually. Around 80 smth. For wriothesley up coming Banner. I wanted him since I first joined gensnin (2023) and u was more than sure I'll get him, since my freind on same Asia server got diluc and then furina in 36 pulls. I pulled also , not counting thst fact that I've lost my 50/50 to dehya, my pity when I got dehya was like 70 or even 80. Not only me suffering w this iss"
Op
If the devs see this please feed back me back cause my phone Infinix smart 9 says doesn't compitable for my phone.
THIS GAME IS REALLY GREAT OVERALL!!
I personally love the game especially since wriothesley is back but one thing I hate is that android doesn't have controller support! It would make it easier on my hands so I would have to hold my large tablet in my hands to play since my computer and phone can't run genshin very well
"Other problems aside, certain features we take for granted they're just too lazy to add them like K&M support, oh and I forgot to mention that they have a shady deal with Apple so they only support controller on IOS but not Android :')"
Good game
"When I started playing this game, I fell in love with it and I really love the open world graphics, the music, the colors and everything. Especially the characters their sp detailed and pretty. I'm not regretting downloading this game"
"Pretty good game. It's got its issues like every game. But, the worst one is having to change my password every single time to get in. I know it's not an issue on my part because I've copied and pasted my password before."
‰∫îÊòüÂ•ΩËØÑ‰∫ÜÂø´ÁªôÊàëÂá∫ËäôÂÆÅÂ®úÔºÅÔºÅÔºÅ
I've been playing genshin for a couple years now and I really like the quests and story. But being f2p is really hard because there's not a lot of rewards. ALSO WHY WAS THERE ONLY 1 NEW MALE CHARACTER?? We neeedd more male characterss pls pls add more male characters!!
The new characters are so bad and the story is terrible.Playing since 1.6 and missing the feeling Inazuma gave me. Wasted potential
Just because of the Aranyaka quest.
"It's a very great game, with no bugs (based on my experience)"
Perfect game
The best of the best
It's a good game
"This has to be the most tedious, addictive RPG I've ever played. Levelling up is time consuming, frustrating and exhausting and you can't progress without spending a week or two building every character"
"5 > 1, its a money hungry ceo's cash cow now; any love this game was made with is gone"
Amazing game great storyline great characters very vaste map to explore the only bad thing about it is they don't give you enough rewards
This game best and awesome and adventure fila
I love this game. Because of it l play 24h
I love this game i had doubts I would make it far with this game
Sick game bro.
This is game is soo eefing cool and stuff but it takes SOOOOOOOOOO long to update.. I'm literally crashing out because I've been wanting to play that game with my friend but it's taking almost A YEARüò≠ I'm literally crashing out right now. But the overall game and the graphics are greatüòÅ
Very interesting
I downloaded this game on Xbox and its so fun but on phone it takes a suprisingly long time but thats cause this game is so big! Its a great game with awesome graphics.
"I just downloaded this game on my brand new Acer Chromebook and it took me multiple times opening the app, restarting the Chromebook, unistalling and reinstalling, checking if any of the files were corrupt for the game to just be able to load properly. I can't get past the loading screen without the game crashing. I did a search to see if it was a me thing come to find out the game hasn't been optimized for Chrome OS as of back in August of 2022. I hope that this can be fixed"
"Genshin has always been one of my dream games to play. And I'm finally playing it!! I've been playing for at least 2 years now, and it's amazing. Even though there are mild lags, it's still a good experience. The open world gives me advantages, and the enemies that I can battle make the experience more exciting. I hope that future updates will include more fun events and activities!"
I've been playing this game for a while and it's Hella good
Excellent
Awful. They make dialogues and cut scenes unskippable to compensate for the lack of content. No wonder why people prefer wuthering waves
It's cool
Fully adventure game I like this game
Love the game
Amazing!
need more endgame contents. need more rewarding. need to balance future characters better.
i love it
I can't open it any more When click the game it's stuck on the loading screen edit it's now solved because of the update
I love this game.My friends showed it to me and I was not expecting it to be this good. 5 out of 5 stars üåü it's amazing üëè
"This is my Favorite game, It's SOOO beautiful and there is so much detail there's also a lot of characters I'd say u should download it right away"
I like this game
Good game
LOVE ITTT THE PLACES MWAHHHH 5/5 luv this Game so much I played it for 1 year already Lumine is doing good
Please fix the ground of natlan it's black many people have this bug
I love it so much
interesting game..but i have only have one issue about it .. can you give us capitino back please ü•∫ü•∫ .. i need itttt
"The security thing is absolutely garbage, it takes too long to get the code, it takes 10 minutes, this is such a hassle for me especially who used cloud version. Remove that feature or find a better security way to log in to my account"
Please help my android to use gamepad
Game got boring for me üíÄ like there is barely any fun events but the story and plot is amazing and all but after the Fontaine story it got boring and like the character released isn't giving any excitement like before
Good
80+ dapet qiqi keren hoyo
Nice game
"The game is fine so far, but just today, I don't know why I can't log in. It says because this game has a ""bug"" and need to wait until the developers update it before I can log in again."
"Very fun, has a lot of characters that are unseen but claimable, I just can't get enough of it!"
I like the introduction but then i don't like the way the sound is like bro
It's pretty good for anime lover and i love this game for lore and art style
Nice
"It's a very good game, amazing art style, character design and so much more, best game I have played in a while. Thanks for the experience"
amazing! i loved every single character and the storyline was amazing
"Version 5.4 sucks! Nothing is interesting. As a F2P, namecard challenge is so badly."
cool
My Overall Experience Is Good And Impressive It Was Fun And With Mixing Emotions To The Story Makes Me Amazed To This Game Im Not Blessed With 5 Star Characters But Im Blessed With Good 4 Star Characters Thanks Hoyoverse For Making This Wonderful Game.
Best game ever
Yippie
Get bored of it hope genshin can improve I hope
"I love itü§©ü§©ü§© Been playing since Jan 2024 and honestly I don't regret it My only regret is not starting from day 1 The graphics, style, the music, the everything! Too bad there is not 10‚≠êÔ∏è cause hoyoverse deserves it I only hope you raise the probability of gaining the characters in wishing and can you bring back the old events please for new players?"
Love this game
seruuu!
I would never forget about how much of good this game is but there still has a room for improvement lots of other games getting ahead of genshin in terms of visual but the story of genshin still remains top 1 hope they hear feedback of their communities that might helps them to grow even further I could have give them 5 star but I couldn't because of one reason If they focus at that then I could well focus at the feedback of you communities that might helps you a lot.
Best of all rpg. Although I wished they introduced a weapon similar to blades of chaos of God of war.
No offense but it's kinda hard to earn more currency things or whatever it's called to get characters and also I do understand that it supposes to be a difficult to get characters in gotcha mechanics or whatever but it rarely very rarely let's you get any good characters and also the ad that said you would get free 10 pulls if you return to the games is a lie
"I love this game, it is a fun game and I enjoy the animations"
Content is lackluster. Does not appreciate the community enough to give out rewards. It's like they're doing it on purpose to bore the community out of this game. They know that they will make money for new characters and popular char reruns.
Please fill the voices
"Stopped playing because the developers decided not to give more rewards as you progress in the game. And there's nothing else to do when you finish all the quests including side quests, just a loop of dailies-spend resins-farm materials-logout. There's no fun unlike the early times."
I love this game it's good game and very interesting
another wonderful game that went down the powercreep path.
"Recently (5.4 patch) After I launch the game it goes to ""checking for updates"" and it stays like that like the game crashed it's so annoying. Like I have to manually leave the game then open again? Why doesn't it like let me play the game?? I'm disappointed at this bug HoYoverse. Fix it asap. Idk if it's only mobile issue or like PC and both. But it's frustrating."
Nice
I went to give 5 star But I need 120 fbs
Don't install the this game because this game is 314560mb
Need password and email I don't have password and email it also pretty fun But it needs wifi too why need wifi??
Thank you genshin impact I was glad to play this adventure game
Awesome
I like it but please make it less laggy
Great
Download shader kellaamaaan
The game is the best game i have ever played
I have loved this so much and I downloaded it like 3 times alr
Love it!!!! Best game ever!!
THIS IS THE BEST GAME EVER!!!
"Dear Hoyoverse, your game is getting boring every patch, all just same not having some new creative idea. The cut scene getting downgrade and lastly is PLEASE HEARD YOUR PLAYER FEEEDBACK, there many feedback on internet. I said this because i have special memory with this game. PLEASE GIVE MORE CREATIVE ON THIS GAME AND THE NEW IDEA. This game (Genshin Impact) make your company big and Famous, please make more effort for this game. Thank You."
It was a nice game
Very smooth play. And graphic Beautiful üòç. I mostly love it
Not bad
It's disgusting
Amazing game‚ò†Ô∏è

Dead game
Not fun anymore. Everything feels repetitive and some events are practically made for a specific recently released character that players may not have. And the newer designs of characters just don't look right for me.
They mess with your wishes. I had 5 intertwined fate and 5 standards. I did 5 wishes on standards came back and my other 5 fates were gone as well.
Amazing
This is an amazing game that has good story lines and scenery i highly recommend to all
I like this game
"I'm a veteran of this game since first release, trust me. The developers never updating their gameplay. The animation suck using animation not in game, while the characters talking it's like delay at the mouth, the movement characters suck. Conclusion, the developers only cares about their profit."
This is so perfect for animation skill and cool charecter
I love the details and the quest and characters it is so fun
Paimon's voice game me tinnitus
"I've been a fan of casual games since the first play station out instead of the competitive ones. Genshin is an action and adventure game, though its challenges are less stressful and time consuming. Therefore, its mechanics and features suit me well. As many people might have known, genshin has a lot of potential that I wish to be unleashed soon."
Very fun game to play with your friends
nice
"IIIIIIIIITS AWESOME!! PLEASE PLAY IT!! ‚ù§‚ù§ amazing graphics characters, land ,plot, just awesome in general!! ‚ù§"
Good game
Impressive!!
There's a bug and keeps kicking me out
Nice game
"Amazing game, great story, amazing quality."
Best game ever I'm so addicted
Very good good game
"The game is up to 40 GB in size, which is too much for mobile phones."
The powercreep is toooooo much!
"Great game, ever since I got it I've been obsessed, the game is amazing and entertaining"
"30 GB internal data, is this game nuts. That is way too much for a mobile game, how do people even play this on their phones. Someone can you explain how your phone handles that much data"
"It is so fantastic game , I like it üëçüèªüòç"
"The best game I've ever played! Top quality soundtracks, graphics and marvelous story."
My dear genshin:) it all start from 3 years ago when i saw a ad and decided to download you ofc at first i didnt knew anything but still it was such a fun when i get to know Hu tao i realy wanted to get her i work so hard just to get her all these 3 years but in these 3 years i get used to you:) in the second year i used to always play lol. Oh sumero it was my best year ever...the best time of my life was back then. but now im not that old traveler im sorry thank you for special memories of me:)
I love it ü§©ü•∞ü§©üòçüòç
"This game is.. quite fun id say. (dont mind my pfp, its me quite some time ago.) the graphics, quality, what sorts are all quite nice, but it takes a DANG load of storage and takes SOOO FREAKING LONG to loud in. atp, i spend more time waiting for it to load then actually play it. (other then that, its nice)"
I love the serenity And thr character are so pretty
"Still unplayable, for some reason I tried logging in to my account using Facebook and the game wants me to verify with a 2FA from an email address that I have not used for years at this point instead of the email address that's literally used to login into my Facebook."
That's impressive!!
"I played this game since the first Venti banner and dedicated YEARS in this game. But sadly, things took a turn in terms of the quality of the game :( I started disliking the story and pacing during Fontaine, the characters there I do love but I cannot bring myself to play any more of those long quests. The side quests are also just as long maybe more, and all it gives you is the tiniest piece of lore. And don't even get me started with Natlan, it felt foreign to what this game had at first."
I like this game but the storage of this game is to much
I love it üíû

I like it
One of the best story line based game I ever played in my life. Thank you genshin impact developers you made my life meaning full thankyou once again and forever
I really love this game and the graphics are out of this world! I just wish it didn't take so long to download but by watching videos on YouTube I learned how to speed up the process 5/5!!
The is no options for a delete button for character your not even using
Love you all
It has been days it is not allowing me to do any events or co op
It's really fun with The realistic graphics and characters it makes me very happy when I get a five star everytime and the long Journey to continue.
A good one
It's the worst game ever I hate that I can't get many characters??? I always lose my 50s and all my limited five star are hard pity and I have no time to play more than 2 hours a day I don't want to spend money too I played for five years and I am not lucky at all I started to hate the game and I will delete it soon if it continued to be like this with me
"Y'ALL ARE LACKING, REALLY LACKING, WUWA ON TOP"
I can only say this game is masterpiece
"Honestly, Natlan alone ruined the whole game for me. I felt like I was scammed. After all the fun moments playing Genshin, the memorable stories of the other nations, the emotional hits and the likable characters, the heartwarming adventures... Natlan was too bland and utterly out of place for me. I don't think I'll ever come back to the game simply due to the fact that I'll never get over the unskippable, lackluster story of Natlan. I'll be seething through it all, it's not worth it anymore."
"Honestly,...I played this game for a few months got to ar 55 and maxed out everything after,I wasn't allowed to play it anymore and this game brings back nostalgia and will forever always be in my heart..."
Fun but took an hour to load
Nice üëç

Still no controller support.
It would be nice but my storage is too big because of the size of the MB or the resources üò≠
This is really fun and hard! I love it!
Good gacha game
Best game ever
"Disappointing, Lack of QoL, Story and content got boring and repetitive. Not to mention paygating features that should have been free to play."
Feels like a chore to grind at this point.
Amazing
"Poor performance in natlan patch, fix it!"
"Make this better please hoyoverse, I still want to play it but the problem is it's so annoying hard and really hard to level, also the rewards are really not enough, please fix everything I love this game."
Nice graphics and easy to navi.
"The game was nice, but the long I play, I'm getting bored of the forever cycle, and the community is so toxic, also the Hoyoverse doesn't put attention to the players and the low quality, selfish! Draining our wallets just to lost on banners."
"Miss Playing ü•∫üíù, As soon i get new high end phone i will download this game"
"Update: Natlan archon story is pretty lackluster, especially after Fontaine's. I feel like Genshin right now doesn't feel as fun and becomes kinda stagnant? Kinda sad tbh since I've been playing from version 1.0. I kinda miss the amazing world quests like Aranara, Jeht's quest, Enkanomiya, etc. I really wish there is a new combat system. I like honkai impact's battle that needs a lot of combo haha. I really hope this game will get better."
"I played dragon nest before, this game has resemblance on it but much realistic graphics. I'll give it a 5 star for now and will continue my Journey."
"Best game I've played since splatoon, highly recommend if you are patient enough to finish the story"
Amazing game
"not bad, not good"
This awesome
I love it!! It's a very lively and adventurous game...
"Good but boring for ar 60 maybe you could add more ar and reward and adds more characters and primo like for every chest you find you get 5-10 primo btw i love itü´∂üèªü´∂üèªü´∂üèªü´∂üèªü´∂üèªso 5 stars i also recommend this for a person who like adventures, traveling, fighting,and stories have fun traveling teyvat"
Very interesting game
Fun game
Add more quest pls
Super experience buttyfull anime story
"Seems the abyyss is upnormal now... Mobile player cannot enjoy this... Again i want to give negative star for the new event called ""Realm of Tempered Valor"". This game is getting bad bad bad. . ."
ITS SOOO GOOD!!!
"No talking, 5 stars."
"Used to love this game... I still play it as of today though l, but the rewards are really disappointing... It's not enough. Same with the wishing system. Just please reward your players better."
This game doesn't support for Gamepad on Android...
I like this game this cause this is multiplayer game and this game story is to good And graphics is best

"1‚òÖ because 59/80 still no Mavuika Weapon, unlike the others who pull just 10/30 they got it early. This RNG sucks bro."
I'll give it 5 star but I didn't play this game because first update is very big ü•∫üò≠but I want to play this!!!!!
Game crashes on my device in loading screen during verifying file integrity
"GENSHIN IS SO FUN!!!!! Its like My favourite game of...ALL TIME!!!! I love learning and exploring! Finding new checkpoints and fighting those slimes and (I think?) Hilicurls (I forgot their name) It's an AWESOME, BEAUTIFUL, AMAZING ADVENTURE GAME (Just like you! üòä) AND I NEVER REGRET INSTALLING THIS EVER!"
This game is so skibidi rizz but i lost 5050 to jeanüò°
"Do you want to play as a MC who sucks, pull for characters with no expressions or soul and play story with group of characters arranged in circle and yap nonstop with same 4-5 animations entire game? Then GI is perfect game for you. No endgame content, no respect for players, feels like a drag to login daily to do nothing but commissions. I used to enjoy this game a lot during my first months after installation, now after playing for 2 years I'm getting bored and lost hope for this game."
Let me pull 1 four star please üò≠
Very thrilling
"Please help, in south india ping is very high, unplayeble"
THE BEST MOBILE GAME IN THE WORLDüåèüåç
Love this game even tho I play at bad graphic XD
"Without a doubt, this is the best rpg on playstore. The graphic and stroyline is great. Needs a bit of time to dowbload (31 gb ++), in the end ita all worth it. Your phn need to hv good specs to enjoy the games more."
I love how you can switch characters and still go adventure off to the woods or something and you also have a map plus gliding wings wish are so awesome and cool BTW but overall I LOVE GENSHIN IMPACT its so cool
Nice game
üëç
So fun game
"As a max level player playing for 4 years straight, farming for artifacts, talent and weapon level up materials has become a chore. I hope that there would be a mechanics or rubrics on how we can increase our chances of getting our desired materials especially towards max level players because playing has became more boring if you have done the events and the quests."
Okay I try but I give you five star‚≠ê
It have very good story the game is very good and paimon is sooo cute
"I can honestly say that this game is a masterpiece. Completely professionally made and unique... But at the same time, there's something about this game that gets on my nerves, and that's that as you upgrade your character, your game rank and world level go up quickly, and you can't just be happy and enjoy the fact that you upgraded your character..."
Nice
This game graphics and quality is good
Only for simps
"There REALLY needs to be a stamina upgrade. So many new nations yet not even a tiny bit more of stamina, seriously? Lagging is not that bad until you get to a bigger nation such as Fontaine and sumeru. For the main story quests or any quests involving dialogue, there NEEDS to be a skip button. Nobody is genuinely reading every single line. There are too many quests that are time consuming and makes this game less fun each update."
I really loved genehin impactü§ïthen I broke my mom's tablet hehe soo it took awhile then I got a new phone and I played this time it was amazing üíôüåå
I would much like it if it wasn't becoming a gooner game honestly. I became to hate this game
"I played genshin for like 3 years. I like the updates, the characters and everything. But every update, it makes the game unplayable because it keeps crashing every move I make. i already clear the past quest data, I already put my graphics straight lowest, I cleaned up my phone deleting unecessary apps, and it still crashes. I haven't gotten a single time where I play peacefully, no lags and such. That's why I haven't grinded a lot these days"
Best
It's the best game in the world üåçüåçüåç
This is so helpfull game if you a guy like advenjers
Primosüëâüëà
"I'm done. Played since 2020. Quit since Feb 2024. QoL changes have been nothing but ""bait and switch"" tactics and poorly implemented. All for filling the devs' pockets. Rewards are mediocre, community gaslights other people into thinking they're greedy for asking for more rewards. Wuthering Waves is infinitely better. There is no hope for this game. Stay far away from this game and its community. Edit: Honkai Star Rail has fallen to the greedy path. ZZZ will eventually. This company is greedy."
So nice
Amazing game i love playing it !

Nice Game
I love this game but We need more rewards plssüò≠üò≠üôèwere depressing
"Genshin Impact is a visually stunning RPG with great combat and storytelling. However, when comes to exploration, may could be improved, especially in chest discovery. Relying on weekly reputation resets is inconvenient‚Äîa character with a passive to scan for chests would help. Chest rewards also feel unbalanced, as tough enemies like Wayob in Natlan drop only common chests. Stronger foes should give better loot. Overall, the game is fantastic, but refining exploration and rewards."
"In all seriousness this game is a mix of anime, Comedy, and good story writing I recommend"
"best game adventure ever, love it.. please give some more primogems free xoxo"
I have played this game before the game is super good everything is super good let's not even start on the graphics but the game needs around 40 G so most people can't play it
I was going to log in for first time it took about 2 hours for the loading to log in and when I was in it was soooooooooooo boring so I stopped playing
bagus
Best game I have ever played

The game is great but there are a few problems such as there are not enough rewards and it is difficult to transfer data files from one device to another
THIS IS GAME IS SO COOL I got reasons first there is so many different characters you can play with and second is pretty realistic very much but this game is worth it to install it

I wanted to give this game a try. BUT 30 GIGABYTES AWWWW HELL NAHHHH. Thats way too much storage needed. Thats a sin. No low end or even mid end phone has more than 128gb of storage. And i only got 8gb of free space left. A shame. I was ready to commit the cardinal sin of giving this game a try. I saw your deleted response genshin team. But im forced to download 30gb first. I cant change any settings for game size prior to downloading the 30gb package. But thanks for responding anyway. God bless
Great gameüòéüòéüòéü•∞
Why there is fps limit max: 60.
"A true piece of art, with some of the most beautiful video game music and graphics I've seen. Extremely smooth gameplay and many quests to complete. The story arc is equally great. Admittedly, 31 gigs of disk space and 45 mins of compilation on initial startup are a lot, not mentioning the horrendous battery consumption, but in the end they're worth it."
This is the best game üòòüòòüòò‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è

i want to play but the phone I'm using has only 64GB storage and the cost more GB than that
This Game is Wonderful It has a very beautiful world. very cute characters and many more things Definitely worth it
"Cannot even simply log in with my account. Keep asking for verification. And your verification take like forever. After that, it exceeds the limits for verification. I never encounter this with any other game. Please fix it."
"need more male characters, stop giving us pick me ahh new character"
this the best game ever
Nice
PLEASE UPDATE THE SECURITY SYSTEM SO MANY ACCOUNT GET HACKED!!
"Absolutely amazing! I love the amazing views, the stunning character designs and not to mention the interesting lore! I love it all!"
Godd game
Phenomenal
It is good game
I thint this is a good game but this game is hard to play in f2p
"The newest version genuinely made me quit. absolutely horrible story, terrible event, terrible rewards. They punished you for not pulling the new characters (with horrible design and gameplay) by making your life so much harder. Without the new characters you can NOT clear new events to get rewards. They said quite a bit ago that they will improve this game, it's absolutely not true. It has only got worse."
Its so fun
"As always, rigged gacha rate. Always lost to standard weapon on limited weapon banner. Dont play this game, you will regret."
I would give this a 5 star rating but for some reason when I tried to login today it started me over and now I'm back at level 1
The game is really nice but I have a problem with my verification code. Whenever I type the verification code so I can link my Facebook to genshin impact it always says invalid code or sometimes it takes too long to send. The game is rly nice tho
You should try this game I love itüòç
I couldn't play this game because it takes too much space
Is fun
It was my dream to play this game lol...but because of my device I couldn't before now that I've a better device not exactly a best one but at least playable I could play my dream game ..and as expected it is best
too much story
Ku tarik kata kataku.
I LOVE THIS GAMEMEMEMEMEMEMEEEE
"Neutral for now, do something"
I hate the fandom
"I played this game since the first banner and a few days ago I had to request an account recovery because of a phone replacement. Hoyo refused to recover my account. I was going to keep playing and paying until the game's end of service. Sad really. At least the new game I play will have all of it's voice actors. Bye, Hoyo!"
Hoyo a bug is not letting me log in on mobile can you help me with this
Just DOWNLOAD ALREADY
"Audio is really bad, always glitching,"
‚ô•‚ô•‚ô•The game is beautiful
not much to do when out of resin.
"I've been playing since 1.2 and while It was fine and really good now it's just declining natlan and the new characters don't have the right design according to lore and zone and the archon quest was more ""let's use the power of friendship"" and it was boring and the new content isn't as interesting as it was but overall a good game"
‚ù§Ô∏è
"Too much ""fun service"" appeared since last big update. Sad"
Very fun open world rpg with an ongoing story line yet to be finished. Many playable characters and more to come. Alot of quests though as well as it picks up alot of storage space and unskipable cutscenes. Over all a very fun game and i recommend it over honkai impact as it is open world from the start.
Nice game but needs a lott of time to grind and is a bit pay to win
4 star because the dialogues are too much and not skip able
Good game
I honestly love the game and the gambles for charecters. BUT when i install it it takes about a week for it to load and it annoyes the heck out of me
Very good
Game 301Mb All Game700Mb
"Natlan's mechanisms actually made the game more frustrating. If you don't have ANY natlan character, then you won't have fun clearing abyss or doing the other endgame content (which there's still so little of.)"
Best open world ever played
Beautiful Game like Never seen before in Android... .
Awesome
Massive storage
"(edited) I've been playing this game since January 16th, 2022. I have no real complaints.. The style is nice but lately there has been TOO MUCH fan service to the point where I'm not even surprised about it anymore, it's honestly ridiculous. But the characters are all interesting in their own ways and there's sooo much more that's gonna be added to the game so it's not rlly boring!! I have an OLD phone (Samsung Galaxy s10e) and it still runs smoothly, sometimes it'll glitch but not too badly!"
"No controller support for Android, on purpose, is crazy."
Horrible game where every essential feature is made inconvenience in mind just annoy or keep you around until you figure how bad it
I like this game
One of the best game I've ever played
"I genuinely hoped to give this piece of garbage called Genshin Impact, a fabulous rating of 0 stars. It is basically designed to squeeze out your money. I have been losing 50/50 consecutively for 7th time since v4.8 or 4.7.I used to be f2p but recently been buying it's welkin moon subscription(basically it's monthly subscription) since 4 months ago, and since then they have been making me lose my 50/50.I hope new players don't fall victim to this money grubing game or it's company. Hope it helps"
"This si my first time playing these type of games.I have nothing say except maybe some better explanation on how to play, suggestions such as what elements fight better against anothe, etc but other than that it is quite enjoyable. I'm only a beginner, I've got a long way to go!!!!"

"i already spend 90 pulls yet i didnt get the weapon on the epitomized path.. I wasted all my pulls, this Game SUCKS!! PAY TO WIN to get higher items!!!! I will not use money again on this game."
soooo goood
yay
"While I'm quite happy with exploring the new region Natlan so far,I can't help but noticed the design for recent character has been downgraded since Fontaine because it seems most newer design for female character has been focusing on fan service and sexualization rather than storytelling for the sake of money.I also see there is significantly a lot less male character release with only Kinich being 5 star male last year and I was hoping we could get more male character like him in the futureü•≤"
??? It's gotten really boring.
Op game
Can't wait for Snezhnaya
Do one thing add skip button on story it's to long just talk talk talk it's iriteting so add a button to skip story and start mission üòä
Good
"Great game. The world and the graphics are amazing and the charactes have amazing designs,But I have one problem. The loading takes too long and I have to wait for minutes for it to start and until then I had to do work.but besides that,the game is amazing,I would give it 5 stars but the loading is a problem.üíñ"
I don't know how to say this.. but could you like speed up the download part of where at the begining of the game start? I haven't even get the chance to play it because of the long download. Could you please make it faster and quicker
Terrible. I am not changing my rating until Hoyoverse shows a single sign of decency towards its playerbase. Period.
Natlan bad.
Genshin suddenly crashed on my phone
The game was super fun mostly but the loading time is so long for me
"Looks like a game I might enjoy, waited for the 34GB download, only to find it doesn't support controller, so I'll be uninstalling! Won't be playing a game like this with my hands covering half the screen, pointless."
Nice game
Best open world game .. love it üòç. Best ....
The game ofc overall its gud....no issue but the main issue comes with the 'Switching Account' from Hoyoverse...The verification code which is suppose to come doesn't comes on time..and It does comes but only after hours or 30 mins...when the limit has already reached.I thought it was due to network problem but sadly it was a Hoyoverse issue itself..and now I can't switch to my main account..and I've even contacted the customer service but no solutionüíîJust hoping u all will fix the CODE DELAY!!
"Hello hoyoverse, my genshin impact app decided to just close after I just entered the game, I don't know why but I've reinstalled the game 2 times already. Please fix this hoyo in every way you can I really need to do my dailies."
I love this game it is so fun and you get to just walk around doing side quests or move the story along it is very fun and the character design is amazing
This game is very very fantastic comparison to other adventure game..in this game have big world we can teleport to other places and graphics are very well üòÅ.some users are read the fake news and blame on the game but they are not deserve it ü•≤.This game is the best who like the anime and High graphics many characters have a different abilities and have a own story.
Omg every single thing is perfect
This game it's best download very high iam reguest in download low 200 100 mb
Not able to login my account and not get helped yet from game if I got any help or I able to login again in game I give good rating

"Very embarrassing for me.After download this game, it's want download a resource pack of 31 GB .How any android user play this game?A garbage in play store."
I like the game but the loading takes so long I left my phone for 10 hours and its still on 20%
"Takes an eternity to compile shaders, seriously. Man I have dimensity 8300 ultra with 512 gb storage üòëüòë"

Pls delete the unlimited characters or the standard banner.ITS SO ANNOYING!! I've wished for the characters I like but instead I got the other characters in the standard banner.You don't know how hard it is to earn primos for the characters we like.And we just lost 50/50?! WASTE OF TIME!
Game is good but the stories has no skip button and take to long to end a story and end of the story you get nothing but you waste your time
Where's the gamepad support for Android?
So good üòç
Disappointed.
"I liked the game since I started playing it but then it suddenly won't launch on my phone even though it's compatible to large games like this, I tried multiple solutions to open it again such as re-installing, clearing data and rebooting my phone. Please fix this issue because I've spent for hours of grinding just to get my game crashed."
Best
Thai game amazing play on mobile!! but problemly is my storage get full. i can't delete genshin because my favourite charecterüò≠
Total fun game.. although maybe large in size but yeah epic
"4 stars because there are so many downloads, it's so bad that my storage is going to fill up, but when I'm in the game, it's so realistic, it's so entertaining. When I first started the game, I didn't realize that 4 hours had already passed."
üëç
That's super
Very cool
"Honestly, I was someone who played genshin since the early-early release and stayed a long-term time player. It became boring and became quite disappointing both in rewards and general gameplay. Of course, as gamers, there'll always be some sort of problem whenever or not it's opinion-wise or gamestyle-wise. But these problems are never fixed, nor ever heard or at least acknowledged. It's getting harder to defend every day, and it's disappointing how bad it fell off. </3"
This is a good game
Best game I ever play in my life
"Hoyo is a master at presentation, but not much else, it seems. Their writing is a pain to slog through, and the typical HP inflation + contrived mechanics route they use for endgame content makes the game more annoying than anything else to play. Pity. (And not the good kind.)"
Fun game
Very good
We need nore rewards pleasee
It's too good game i can never before play this type of game it's too good but i need to wish star it's to hard to collect ü§ß
"Cool game, but the company doesn't seem to care about player feedback. For a game that's popular internationally, Mihoyo only seems to care about what Chinese netz think more than what the rest of the fandom has to say. I really like the game play, story, and characters, but I feel that the old fun vibe fell off after Natlans release. I hope that the next nation, Snezhnaya, will be as amazing as Fontaine instead of the mess Natlan is."
"You can't use a controller, I can connect my ps5 controller in Wuthering Waves."
Everything went downhill since Natlan. I don't like the direction this game is going.

"Genshin's Resin system is actual hell. It regenerates so slow that farming feels like a full-time job with no pay. Boss fights? You burn through Resin just to get garbage drops. Artifacts? Pure RNG pain. Weekly bosses eat up even more Resin, so good luck farming what you actually need. And don‚Äôt get me started on the gacha‚Äîit‚Äôs basically a scam unless you‚Äôre rich.

Some of the character designs are still cool, but I just don't like their play styles. The latest few updates just does not make me want to play and save primogems anymore. Some of the changes in the characters' character towards Aether just grossed me out. It just feels more like a gf sim now(imo)."

"It is mixed review from me. I've been playing since version 1.0 I only play the game because this game has big lists of playable male characters, for Shonen themed manga lover like me, this game is exciting. Then I watched Fatui Harbingers trailer. Excited to get my hand on The Captain. Yeah, you guys know now, I have less excitement in version 5.. but I managed to still playing the game."
Im so happy to see Paimon and co-op with my friends! Thank you HoYoverse :)
Glitching
Very skibidi
"Really exciting game, never gets boring!"
Awesome
The app keeps closing whenever I tried to login.
Best game ever forever
"Paimon is annoying as hell, most of the problems start because of her. Genshin can't choose between if Aether is a character in game or a self insert of the player There is no skip button of dialogue The resin cap is too low The materials take too long too gather due to domain limitations Artifacts are a pain to collect, don't bother with them before rank 45 Can't get past event rewards The new characters look worse it caters to Reddit mods"
"Though this game is very laggy, it's still an entertaining game.But it takes up a lot of space, and also when updating, it takes forever for it to load. So genshin please add faster updating speed. Especially since updating for phase 1 takes forever! (Also please add more men) Still, please voice a little more! Since during the lantern rite, most of the characters were unvoiced"
Nice anniversary reward you have there mhy
Very good
My ID is literally Cursed i am on ar 56 and still only have frikin 4 chosen 5 star and one 1 5 star weapon that i wanted !! Idk if this is bug or what but I'm quitting permanently cause I'm literally the unluckiest person of the game
Very Nice game All Anime Lover Download This Game ‚ù§Ô∏è
You need to add more languages. It would be great if you add Bengali and Indian languages. The game is gaining popularity in India. Adding Indian languages will make it more popular.
"Genshin Impact is a fun game, but the Gacha system is a complete mess for F2P players. After hours of grinding, I lose all my Primos with almost no chance of getting the character I want, even when you claim there are 'increased chances.' Most of the time, I end up with characters not even on the banner. This is infuriating! Games should be for player enjoyment, not to trap us in a broken system that forces you to spend money to get anywhere. It's a total SCAM."
Forced co-op for primos during events isn't fun.
"It's quite reasonable, and pretty cool, recommend playing"
"No story skip/Event button. Hoyo is anti critics and never listen to their own playerbase, and keep sucking them dry for money. Natlan so disappointing that they made the region P2W, and for 4 years no skip button and avg of 9hrs in game story time is insane."
Best game in the world üåé‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
"Amazing, never stop playing, this best game ever"
Best game graphics and story line I am impress
Wuthering Waves is a better alternative This game is for easily exploitable minors. -minigames are 2 ez -colors are over saturated -story is baby clarified -quality of life features are being held back for when the game is older -game mechanics only builds on top of wut they alrdy hav
Give me primogems
Without voice artist game seems dead to me we need voice artist back
1 star lang kasi hindi mo binigay saakin si furina!!!! ganti ng api!!!!
Make gaming 5 star
"please mihoyo,past banner which is clorinde I've all out on her but STILL got nothing but I believe you've got something better for me and yes now,there is wriothesley and I've just all out on him too and now my primogem is all GONEEE and I STILL GOT NOTHING!!!!PLEASE MIHOYO I'm an F2P player not like the other streamers üòäüôÉ but i still enjoy playing your game and overall it really nice and the best experience i have ever so I'll put 4 starsüòä"
I really like it... That's all...
Good game
Wasted my time saving up primogems just to get a tighari at 54 pity this pmo so much!!!
It won't send me a verification code. I tried both of my emails and neither worked.
"Saya gabisa login karena menunggu verifikasi kode dari email baru diterima setelah 5menit, ketika input kodenya sudah expired"
ghatiya game mobile ultra HD main bhi tati hey graphic
"the controls in this game are a disgrace and a horror. There is no way to change the button layout, the squad list only displays 3 characters, switching between them they constantly change places, which makes it impossible to make a quick rotation like on a PC, you should to add all 4 on list, the hands of the person who came up with this idea should be torn off. This is a disgrace and a slap in the face to mobile players from the developers, a disgrace - this cannot be fixed even after 4 years"
Bad
Plz fix full screen problem. My poco f6 not full screen open.
"Beautiful backgrounds, characters, and cool moves! But... you can't even hecking download it in mobile! What's the point if you can't even get logged in??"
Good.love the game
Nice game with best graphics and world.
Ok
Good game i really like this game never expected a game like this was on phone
"Wow, how can a region fall off so bad after fontaine. With quality of life fixes and suggestions being ignorned and devs blatantly ignoring criticism and actual player feedback, I've just stopped playing."
"Updated review 04.03.2025: Played since 1.0. At first, it was a pretty good game during the pandemic and whatnot. But recently it's not really that exciting anymore. After the peak that was Sumeru and Fontaine, Natlan feels bland. Like, in general. The only character I genuinely liked from that nation was Capitano. The game could do better, but I feel like they won't"
"The gacha system are just horrible, you spend hours to collect the primos and never get the character that you want, the rate are very low"
"it so boring . don't wanna play anymorr, i can't get my furina at low pityüòë"
"gak usah install ini game lagi, developernya kikir. QoL-nya juga gak ada perkembangan signifikan, apalagi apdet map Natlan makin ancur temanya. udahlah mending ke game sebelah aja, buat player pensi yg mikir mau kambek, mending jangan dulu deh, mending tunggu Snezhaya sekalian kalo memang masih penasaran sama storynya."
"I'm pouring my heart out, barely getting anything back. It's not fun anymore. I've been playing since the start, it was fun, but the game's going downhill!"
"When you reach the end there's nothing to do but walk around picking mats. It's tediously boring! There's nothing remotely fun in these dry patches. It's an okay game, really, but when you beat the story and have to get quests from daily commissions it's horrible."
O gacha definitivo
1 atar because i lost my 50 50
My six year old can't stop beating it after he downloaded the game. He beats it for hours on end
Best game if you like anime üëç. Also if you are bored of games ending to fast this game will take years for you to complete ‚úÖ.
This is So Awesome I love This Game üòç‚ù§Ô∏è
"Game used to be incredibly fun and magical. Such a shame the absolute and never ending greed and increasingly exploitative predation of the company towards the players has ruined it. Game became ""too big to fail"" so the devs never bother to innovate or listen to their players wants. Only thing they see in this product are $$$, and the players are their means of getting as much of it as possible, with as little effort put in as possible. Game meant a lot to me during some hard times. A shame"
Best Game
Everything is ok. They just need to add a way to join a different server and keep you data from the previous server.
"The best open world game all over the play store reminds me of Zelda and Horizon Zero dawn...... being honest there is no cons what so ever, this console level experience in the palm of your hands.Really loved it."
Good
Have Really Bad Gacha System the wish is not 50%50% but it 90%10% the gacha really is rigged. The dev really make sure you will never get what you wanted. and you have to really grind in this game and if you are a F2P it will take years just to guaranteed get only 1 character/weapon. Bad game reward. No point of making tons of event it useless.
After natlan I somehow didn't enjoyed this game.
The event sucks. Not f2p friendly lol
This is such a best game at no cost available on all platforms and also the graphics gives a vibe of happiness and joy and the small games and events give very happy moments to me and also the character designs are good
"Honestly since Natlan released it feels like a completely different game and it's quite boring and it feels like the devs just want people to spend money, not actually enjoy any of the characters or storylines. Might come back if they go back to Fontaine's standards."
"I love this game, I have so much fun playing it and I love most of its features, the story and game play is amazing, the soundtrack is awesome and farming in this game is very fun, I've been playing this for almost 2 years but I fear I might have to quit soon, this game takes up too much storage space for mobile players. Edit: I quit a while ago, I dont like this game. It's too repetitive and the fans are weird"

Tried to pull for Wriothesley but got Mona instead wasting 90 pulls. I hate this game so much. At least in Wuthering Waves I get the characters I pulled for without getting other characters.
I never get a five star even with the capturing radiance
Preety impressive gameüçìüçìüçìüéÄüéÄ
"from 5 sttar to one star, thanks for gatekeeping more rewards hoyo, you are now incredibly bad"
it's better than weathering wavesüò§üò§üò§
"In the view of gacha , WORST gacha game !! The game is good though ! just a bunch of greedy people controlling the game for getting money GENSHIN IS GREEDY"
"I used to absaloutly loved it especially the amazing quests in sumeru with IlDottore but after fontaine with the release of natlan i think the game has been going in a very different direction, Fan service characters and not releasing as many male characters slowly turning the game into a pay to win waifu game. Farming is very difficult with only being able to get a couple artifcats that are any good and only being able to get specific materials on certain in-reallife days making it tedious."
GOOD! GOOD! GOOD! One of the best game I've ever played in my life .. This game is absolutely fascinating!!!
Its perfect i love it
Very good game fascinating and amazing graphics
Very addictive game Just some lag in server some time But very good üíØüòä game
Literally every other game >>> genshin
I like this app game
Best and relaxing game I ever played
Giving 1 star cuz u devs notice this respected sir/ma'am actually the thing is I wasn't knowing that genshine and honkai star rail isn't available for ps3 and I bought it without knowing much about ps can you please make these games available for ps3 as well plz
GAME JELEK GAME SCAMMMMMM
gameplay-nya kurang satset
Trash
An unforgettable adventure for those who love anime
Perfect üî•
Gave Mona for 5 star on the featured banner.
"primo farming sucks, but graphics and the story is awesome but due to poor primo economy it's very hard to earn characters"
Very good
Good game
I love this game
I like it
Love the game just wish android had controller compatibility like iPhone ....
Op
This game is good but the thing is the gacha system is quite unfair. Especially as a f2P I suffer from notbgetting a five star or loosing 50/50 to another five star. Other than the gacha system I quite enjoy the game especially the story and events.
gacha system is sick!
This game is very good
Should add a skip dialogue option. Grinding starconches on lyrue beaches for Childe just sucks. My phone apso overheats everytime I play from 15 mins. But overall 5 stars.
Worst game ever created in human history. To lvl up your character u need to schedule so that you can lvl and use that character. Don't even talk about worst gacha system in this game. They added 50/50 in weapon system 50/50 in character banner if you miss those 5* limited banner character we don't know when they will get there rerun. Just fix your game mihoyo it worse than wuwa.
Perfect
Today I got lost 50/50 by pulling on furina but I get qiqi for for the first constellation. This sucks pt. You don't have no idea how much I get spend more time to earn a farm on my priogems to get my Furina but the genshin didn't get me what I want for my character favorite. You deserved 1 star review for now. I hate you qiqi ( ‡ΩÄÕù ‚àß ‡ΩÄÕù )
"TO WHOEVER WHO CREATED THIS GAME, ILY ILY ILY, THE BEST GAME EVER"
"Imbis na Furina, Jean ang binigay"
Good
kawalang gana kayo
"The story is boring, too long, there's no skip button or whatsoever. Also the pity system sucks. I'm already guaranteed and I still didn't get the character I wanted, AKA Wriothesley, when guaranteed, you're supposed to get the character easily but this time, I still didn't get the character. The new character designs sucks, natlan is boring and is straight up exhausting to continue the story. The new characters have boring splash arts, and designs, nothing cool or new whatsoever."
ONE OF THE AWESOME GAME THAT I KNOW ü´°
game kikir
Trash
i didnt get the wrio then got rage quit.
"very good. the problem is i always lose to mona ON HARD PITY. Genshin, if you're reading this, i swear to you if i lose another 50/50 to mona SPECIFICALLY, i will give out bad ratings to your game. EVERY. SINGLE. ONE."
I lose 50/50 on wriothesley my pookie Wookie husband and you gave me dehya üò°üò°üò° give me wriothesley üò≠üò≠üò≠ wriothesley üò≠üò≠üò≠ #iwantwriothesley
This game is good but I have only problem about his character pull system it's cruel Because I lost continuously 3 times in a row 50 50 so this game the kinda Boring and for f2p players this a nightmare so please do something about this I play for the game Because of furina and now she come I just lose this is worse hoyo Verse
It has many details that we can't see in payed games too
Sorry to say but It's very difficult to get an legendary character. I give up
Good
Awesome game
"I've been playing since day 1. Its highly addictive and I wouldn't recommend it for those younger than 15 y.o. bc of predatory monetization mechanics. But through this game I met a lot of friends irl and it will forever stay in my heart. If only the devs weren't so stingy with rewards, especially that since fontaine, core parts of kits are locked behind constellations. But game itself is great. Some bugs to fix: Xbalanque cape, mizuki quest bakus' hair and tassel."
BISA GA KLO NGASIH RATE OFF DI PITY RENDAH GAK USAH 73 AN MMK
50-50s are stupid
"Worst game ever..... Believe me it's no fun in this game, game developer will get rich, I recommend wuthering wave than genshin impact"
"Good game, beautiful environment and music, the story quite good. But in a few updates too much yapping in a quest, not on point and gacha weapon banners has the most worst weapon gacha system among zzz and hsr. Mostly lost rate off and if the banner change rate on is not guarantee. Really ridiculous. I hope dev solve this out but i know genshin dev not gonna hear their player tho."
PLEASE!!! REMOVE THE LOSE 50/50!!!!
Gooner game
i just want to say genshin will never
Enjoy playing it
Good üòä
This game is awesome! I really like this game.
Natlan was lackluster compared to fontaine.
üëç
I like the way the World quest and especially the Archon Quest progress throughout the game
Fun
"Very good game, amazing storyline and graphics, fun and diverse gameplays, everything is great on the game side. The one star i can't give them is because of the lack of rewards that actually feel rewarding. Edit: one year after my first review, they fixed a lot of things, leveling up characters is much more fun and easy, rewards are way better, there are more diverse gameplays with each new region, they finally earned their 5th star üåü"
"Genshin impact deserve 1000 stars , cuz I have so historical about genshin impact and the reality gods who exist in real gods of seven and also in genshin impact too gods seven japan , it's super amazing, I am indian but praise to become Japanese , Hoyolab U guys are the best Ever Developers of the game , I have learnt alot from genshin impact thank u so much for this best reality anime game"
It's a fun open world game that I feel as grown alot in terms of content that its unfair to call it a BOTW clone now.
Nice ever game i play
"My besto frendo hate the natlan community that's been go around wildly in the internet, their actions are kinda a bit childish on different gacha games that's been started lately for example they're saying ""this is a copy of *this game*"", i know your fans are very supportive and loyal to your games but their minds are a little bit twisted for thinking that every gacha games are a copy of yours, that's all thank you i hope you teach your gamers/fans/users some lesson."
Best graphics game ever seen bro this is becoming my favourite game . üëå
I love this game it's very addictive I d want to put it down for long
"Because I keep loosing my 50/50 and I hate it, over all characters are pretty and beautiful scenery but I hate the 50/50 system hope my next pull is a 50/50 win, thank you hoyoverse"
Fix low and divce lag free game playing pelies
"Out of all the games I have played till now, I personally like genshin impact the most but I have only one problem that I waste a lot of my time playing this game. And there is nothing bad in it, its graphics, story and characters are all the best That's why you should definitely try this game once, especially I like its music very much."
Not rewarding enough for the effort needed to get something [Even then its NOT GUARANTEED] Absolute PAY TO WIN I don't recommend playing this game unless u want to spend some money else don't bother even downloading this trash

"It's a game that has a big world exploration, lore, elements, characters, and gambling. A big community, new drama each character comes out.. The dialogues are long, but come on you're doing quests!"
Tolong beri aku Shogun di dunia nyata
This is the one of my favourite game and also I like the open world concept
"hello I have been playing this game for about five years, but the characters are no longer interesting and diverse, and it seems that the game is only for girls, because out of fifteen characters (five stars), there is only one male character, and this is really awful, that is, only six percent.If you assigned the game to girls, then change the name of the game (for example, let it be a game for girls...)"
Best game in the world üòçü§©‚ù§Ô∏èüíñ
I just give up this point
"The games ok, the company and the community however are both not worth what you find in a septictank..still no controller support on android"

Bro I like this game but it take too much time to download resorse pack
It's amazing and fun but had to uninstall because it took up to much space
This game is a badass awesome I would like to play this game so far and I enjoy this game
this game crashes on my phone after playing for about an hour 888+ processor please fix it

"Such an awesome game!! You can really tell how much love and time Hoyo put in this game for players!! There are so many haters when they just need to enjoy the game, love you hoyo!!"

Its super
One star because of last event that is worst ever!!!!
"They make events that not everyone can participate fully in, you're left feeling left out after struggling for days trying to achieve the event reward unable to. I really want the event reward and I'm going mad trying to get it, my characters are fully built, Max level and still can't do it. Very bad quest design where you have to sit through pages and pages of talking and dialogue when all you want to do is play the game, no skip button, this makes it even more annoying if you restart."
I hate what has become of game. I hate the boring characters and I hate natlan. I wish characters like fontaine were back
Natlan makes me sad
"Despite all the company's mistakes, this game is certainly one of the best I've ever played! ‚ô°"
"Great game all around, and if controller support for android finally gets added, this will be the best game I've ever played"
Just perfectly splendid
"This game is really fun! I had trouble with the Arcadia quest but I managed to complete it. It's really challenging and super fun. I really like it. But the part that annoys me is that it takes FOREVER to load the game when u first download it bcz for me it took ONE WHOLE HOUR and it annoys me really much but in rest, the game is great and it works properly!"
I love it but I wish It gave to more reward.
Very bad. Could not even open the game
Nice game üòç
"Honestly, I love genshin impact, it has good graphics and cool lore, beautiful places like inazuma, fontaine...(Extra) It's my favorite game, I play it daily, it's online and very fun, I love this game so much, but I don't get why people hate natlan, anyways, it's the best anime game!!"
"Promoting gambling in an way that children can have it, do not be fooled devs are not listening and they only want money that's for sure. If your only care in this game is when it gives you free primogems you are making this game even worse than it is because you are not actually caring for having fun while playing the game that you like and spent time and your own money on. Still playing this game only out of nostalgia but i beg for this game to change something before the lore will end.üò≠"
"I have played this game since it was launched. I stopped playing because of work, and Now playing it again so much has change and it has a bigger map. great open world visuals as usual. I hope you give more entertainment. For those Free to play players out there keep grinding. I played genshin because of its lore. keep up the good work!"
üëçbest game ever
"This has become my comfort game, simple, beautiful and huge. You can enjoy the game and the story without focusing on the ""fan service"" as they say."
"Playing 2.5 years,this is a really good game,but the problem a lot of small inconveniences,(can't skip conversations,can't farm too much materials,can't farm too much bounties for mora,can't have too much resin) and all this small inconveniences makes you feel uncomfortable and after a while you stop playing, because developers so focused on something that doesn't matter, overall my advice,is make your players happy and they would pay 10x more,because happiness, enjoyment - it is what we want."
"The game starts off good. But it gets worse and worse the more you play, to the point where it becomes impossible to continue. Stay AWAY FROM THIS GAME. It is dangerous."
"Honestly the game isn't bad it's the fan art and the community, yes the characters are definitely quite fan servicey, but still, it's a great game and the character design are unique to many other games, cut the slack and go complain about bloody blizzard entertainement or EA atleast genshins company doesn't force it's players to spend haenous amounts of money just to get one good character (i pulled candace on my first 10 wishes that are free)."
Highly recommended
Why my Xiaomi 11 lite 5g ne not support 90 fps in this game Pls fix and I will give a 5 star for this gameüòÅ
This game is beautiful I love what characters look they made
A good gameüòç
This game is nice but add more characters is more I could play genshin
"It is best high graphics, with best storyline and adventures game I had played in my phone I love this game ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è"
I luv it
This game is awesome
Good game
"Why does Natlan characters are mostly female? I only saw Kinnich. Also Varesa, why does her gameplay looks like that? this is so fan service. I missed old genshin so much."
"no skin and no gender diversity while the game itself doesn't specifically stated to carter towards women lovers and white skin culture, natlan look like a cheap modern cowboy fantasy movie and it's progressing cheaply too with no good amount of character attachment. Huge dissapointment than previous versions."
"After playing Genshin Impact for almost a year, I have learned of methods to torture myself that I hadn't previously known existed"
great
"I just started to play Genshin like i do every weekend, now i have a new phone with more space, it's been so beautiful. My 11 year old grandson gets me the harder ascension materials, üòÑbut i stopped for a minute to say, you are so very kind, i know i don't have to spend money in this game, because every day you provide so much, all for free. My mum has a ps4 and 5 and she's paid a lot of money for games, and you don't get the kindness that we get from this game. You're amazing, thank you üíû"
These game is so cool broo I think I am a anime character üòéüëçüèª
"I've always wanted to play this game, recently bought a new phone and installed this game, what can i say it's like emotionüòå, so far i loved everything of this game (except summoning system - didn't get 5star character yetüòÅ)"
"This game is top tier and absolutely high quality! From the amazing epic story and lores, to the immersive gameplay, the amazing soundtracks, the cool designs, the fun open-world adventure, the wishing system, and so many more. I do, however have a few suggestions. 1 is that there should be more diversity in the nations, especially in Natlan. I love Genshin, don't get me wrong, but this is one of the reasons of why Genshin gets negative feedbacks. 2 is to maybe have regular free daily awards."
I love it all of it just amazing 5‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è‚≠êÔ∏è
I like genshin
No free character on 1 anniversary
Best game and i miss playing this. Im on a hiatus coz my phone broke. On my 2 months playing this im inlove with this game so much. And i promise I'll be back if i had a new and capable phone for playing this!
"Everything become boring, bro release so many gooner girl characthers. HSR players can't relate. Had the floppiest banners, and the whole new genshin impact is full of yappadity yappity yap yap, where's the RPG bro?? 2+ hours yapping and literally 5 mins fighting. Boring ‚ô°"
it can be a good game if you can somehow ignore the rng hell that is the artifact system
Lumayan bs makan waktu bosan
Stunning graphics with best story recommendation on top for playing spending data and time is worth it...
Bro the best story with the best twists and most of the characters are pretty good even if the 5 star character has bad kit you can build it to be useful you can actually take any 3 of your favourite Characters and add one good support character and team will work really well together for example I took mauvika and diluc with jean this team will not work together but add a kazuha or chasca even furina this team will work really nicely
Loved this game
I lost my phone bc of this my sister won't let me play on mine bc her phone laggy with this game. Thanks genshin XD
ÿ®ÿßÿ≤€å ÿÆŸàÿ®€åŸá
Lack of much needed qol still such as no way to quick start events and main event durations being too short. character design and direction have taken a left turn from the in world designs that the new kens feel out of place. Blatant powercreep especially with the latest evet needing higher constellation characters and a specific character to clear efficiently.
Please give me very enjoying and graphic on top
So good experience
I love genshin SM but It costs a ton of storage
"""Genshin could never"" is all I need to say. Respect your players like they deserve and you will get a better rating."
Good
Good
perfect
Too heavy
Fantastic game love it
Perfect
Mail security long time for send aty mail about need time soo much I waiting not send yet 10 minutes ago
Super fun
GENSHIN COULD NEVER
awesome üòé
Why so heavyyy üò©üò©üò©
Super and good to go
Coquette and slay
"Goodly, games but base Swap Characters. Want swap characters class of yours personally types. But lack of Touching Screen UI set up. Lack of Aim Assists for Controlling Setup. Waste my phone are is storage device. If compression file is good on low end device"
This game is amazing
Trash
one word: BEST.
33gb is a joke
anknown intro(mysteries)(10/10)
Game pelit any kikir.
I really love this game one of my fav game.The graphic is so great for an mobile game.The story are very awesome.Genshin Impact is a playable anime
"this is too much grinding and fail to balance the fun in exploring. not to mention those confusing puzzle which i personally found not creative at all. been playing for a solid 3 years and im burning out. the reason im staying is because I've been a fan for a long time but idk man , it's been a while since i stopped logging in. im looking forward for more better stuff. couldn't imagine my 2021 self would say this kind of stuff about the game tho. the visual is good."
This is best game
Peace üïäÔ∏è
Best graphics
Good

"The game is kind of mid, especially if you're not spending millions of dollars on it. The new updates are releasing characters that are much more powerful than older ones, and adding enemies with more HP, forcing players to spend MORE MONEY. I'm f2p and this game is really starting to lose it's fun side and becoming more of a greedy cash-grab attempt. It's focusing more on fan service and money than making the game actually fun. I used to love this game, but now it just rubs me the wrong way."
One fo the best game ever üòéüòÅ
I love this game!!! Best game ever played
"Great game! But need more guides for newbies, like upgrading items, or crafting."
"Scam banners system and unfair rotation, always provide mediocre update with no QoL improvement. Devs not doing easy thing that could improve player experience, always add something that unwanted by player. No feedback hearing session, hoyoverse just care about their opinion to their own game and how to make more money out of it. Da Wei's cry speech was just a gimmick. Wuthering Waves did all the thing better, if u have higher device specs, better to uninstall this game and move to wuwa"
10/10 game so relaxing and the art is great I love this game
"Gatcha system is rigged, the game is too much for android to be played comfortably"
"Super fun! The only thing is that I'd like to add a skip dialogue button, and add more things to do for endgame players."
GOATED. The story line is awesome is almost impossible to skip.
I can't even login. It says invalid code eventhough I entered the right verification code
I love muavika
"I can't even use the game!! Every time the last symbol tries to load, the game crashes!! >:( Please fix this. I would like to try the game."
"The first three versions of Genshin were amazing, delivering a groundbreaking open-world experience on mobile. But over time, the QoL features have become outdated, and the gameplay feels increasingly repetitive. With its reliance on limited-time content that fuels FOMO, I find it harder to enjoy playing for long. Might as well go back to playing Breath of The Wild than to gamble for some power creeping simulator."
Fantastic üòäüòª
"Pay to win in a gacha game, how surprising. Devs are getting lazy and power creeping older characters. Stale and repetitive meta (pull new characters or good luck)."
Perfect Open world
Good game i like this game
its cool the characters are too good
Goated ngl
"Quite good graphics, good storyline, pretty good details in the story, and that's all."
I love this game on my S24 ULTRA.
Nice game
I love genshn impact because of the storyline and characters and I like going to different places and there is lots of experience in this game üòä
"Come hoyo it's been long time i have been waiting for this console mode on Android,just why only on ios????,its been 4 year i have been waiting for this so long,im sure lot of android player want this console mode!"
I love it
Fun interactive open world and peaceful and enjoy and relaxing and smoothing experience
"I love the game, but the problem is the players they are to toxic and annoying not to mention they are more toxic on social media. I'm gonna give this 1 star player matters first."
The game is so cool
"Hoyoverse is getting too greedy, don't spend money on their games. If you want a better game who's Dev's actually listen to their players, play Wuthering Waves"
It's a very good game but I am on a phone and I would like it if it was on tablet I love the game
It takes forever to load
Omgg
I really like the storyline
Best
I love the game I'm obsessed bish. Thank you üíó‚ú®.
"I am going to be completely honest about it this. I have been a playing for almost 4 years, I joined since the game came out. At first, the game was beautiful, vibrant, full of life and opportunities. Not to mention, respected women's bodies. As we have moved into this new Natlan update, things began to take a BIG downfall. Women now have no clothes, the story is really childish, and what is this nasty Bathhouse update?! I have honestly decided to leave from this because of how disgusting it is."
The game is fun to play for 20 minutes and then the resin ends.

Imagine playing genshin jeez
"In Genshin Impact, players can't transfer accounts or add friends from other regions, which is the only issue I've noticed in the game. Also, if you've been given the option to skip a conversation, the skip button will be available."
Varessa sucks ..
THIS IS SO AHHH
"Love this, I missed my FF days Leveling and completing Mission to help people üòç‚ù§Ô∏è"
"As a passionate gamer, I have to say that Genshin Impact is a masterpiece of modern gaming. The breathtaking open-world design, combined with an intricately woven narrative, creates an experience that is nothing short of immersive. The dynamic elemental combat system adds a layer of depth and strategy that keeps every battle engaging, while the richly developed characters make the story even more compelling."
‚ù§Ô∏è
This game is really good
"I like it personally. I play for the main story, I want to see how the travellers journey will end. Some of my biggest questions are like ""At the end of genshin, what'll happen to Nahida and Rukkhadevata? Will Nahida really remain the archon?"", ""Does dottore burn irminsul?"", ""Is morax perhaps a descender?"" etc. It'll be interesting to see the end of the journey."
"Bad actually when you install the game and enter. You have to download 30k+ MB of resources before getting in. I recommend you this game, unless you want to wait for years to finish downloading the resources."
"Heyy, I would like to give feedback, would u add skip feature for quest pls.., too much dialogue.., sorry i have to say this, The next game has satisfying features... please add skip quest feature thank youu"
i love this but why does Traveler have a 4 star animation when Traveler is a 5 star??
Please genshin impact give more stable game on mindrang devices
Best game
Nice game
Wonderful Fun And just....WOW!!
"I used to love the gameplay but now it's nothing but a cheap cash grab with poorly written storywriting, terrible security, developers who don't listen to their players and basically not the same game I used to know. Please if you could Stratford taking out feedback and truly making this game special, it might bring back the magic it had a long time ago"
I like the gaming experience
One of the favourite game
Best game ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èü§é
I remember that I used to love the game but now after the 5.0 update I feel like the game has changed and became more of a fanservice and cash grab game with all the new characters
It's amazing
"Game is awesome. Been playing for long but still no changes on the artifact drops. Like I've been farming for a while now and I still get zhit ones. I just wish they'd chill on the DEF. One more thing is the rewards. Basically you do this and that for a few Primogems. Maybe increase them a little idk it's just not enough compared to HSR and other games. Still, good game."
Ë®≠Ë®àËÄÖËÇØÂÆöÊ≤íÊúâÂú®Áé©ÈÅäÊà≤
I honestly really want to give genshin five stars but the only issue I have is the lag with mobile player it's has really been a struggle and I hope it gets fixed soon.
"honest review, you have 4 years ahead every open world gacha games but you still dont have skip button & loadout artifact. special mechanics are locked behind limited chars. i'll give at least 3-star if you give us players a skip button, i dont want to spend 3 hours clicking meaningless conversation, you need to respect your players time."
Stunning experience
BEST!!!
Maganda lang
"Artifact RNG so bad , always PRIORITIZE Deff stats HP. HP% DEF% every time lv up always this stupid stats increases ..hyper carry like Xiao with DEF and HP stats are useless !! Low dmg , bored game in 2025 no improvement about Artifacts stats ..."
The fantasy vibe faded slowly
Well is awesome and great
This is my first gacha game and I play 24/7 a lot of the time. This game is my favorite gacha game ever
Please controller support in android
"Unless you're going to pull every new character to c6 which cost like 300 dollars you will not be allowed to play this game and have fun, all the endgame, all the event and everything else is locked behind specific characters and they will never give you enough currency to get those characters every update unless u shill out hundreds and hundreds lg dollars, DO NOT PLAY!!!!"
"Nice game, but I hope to add the Arabic language or add a skip button for all the words"
Cool
Biotifeulle
I love this game
Completely awesome and fantastic
"The reason I'm only giving 2 stars, the game is amazing but because after Nathan's release most of the sounds and voices are missing, from most of the characters and some dialog in the traveler's log, doesn't even work like the elemental release, for pyro and his burst and some things explaining natlan there's no sound what so ever."
Fun to play
Best and most imaginary game i've ever played.
"Need QoL updates, such Skip Story (Summary) , Few Characters voice is not avalaible. Resin save like HSR for reducing stress if not login/busy days. although everything is good"
This game is tutty.
This is the first gacha I'm playing and it's all fun
I love it so much
Nice game
"I haven't played genshin for a year now. Genshin gave me many memories. I played from the release of this game. I don't really like the game now, but I understand that nothing can stay the way it was and that Genshin would just get boring if it stayed. So I thank mihoyo‚Äî no, hoyoverse for my memories. Really, thank you. The game is wonderful."
The game is good at the start. The character design we're pretty cool.
For the main line stories some of the characters randomly just don't have voices anymore
"Love Natlan! The Natlanese designs are amazing, been loving all of them so far. I wish there were some more Story Quests and Hangouts especially, there are so many characters to be explored during the dry patches. Besides that, I've loved the game ever since I started playing (3.4), and way more ever since 5.0!"
It's good game ugh
Very nice üëçüëç game
"One of the best games I ever played, never lost a 50/50 good job hoyoverse, keep it up!!"
All in one
Very good game üéÆ
I never play game like this before
"i js love it like mwaaa, but heyyy gimmeee more primoogeeemssss T__T"
*DONT DOWNLOAD* If your reading this to the comment or the reviews and ratings. Don't download! First I saw mutilple genshin impact ads on TikTok or YouTube. I deicide to download it just to try. When I download it loads for a while until it ends on 23 hours. When I go back the game 23 hours later the screen froze and kicked me off. It keeps glitching on my phone screen I tried to stop it by power off and rebooting it prevents me from doing that and my phone shuts down and the phone broke.
Genshin impact plz give the players more primogems
i love this kind of game
not bad at all
Amazing game
üëç
Gooner game
"Awful game, and a waste of your time and money for a company who doesn't care about their players"
That's the best game ever I love adventures

"I used to play the life out of this game, and it was very fun to play, along with the updates. As time went by though, the game got more irritating. Many things either take weeks to unlock or are stuck behind payments, the dialogue of the game is very, VERY long, and the characters are honestly just boring. Along with how badly this game lags, then the characters don't fit the cultural appearance they should have based on their region. This game truly needs to be remade all over again, sorry."
"I very disappoint with this update the new artifact system is a scam in your live stream ""now you can edit your artifact with stats and sub-stats that you want"" it so expensive to get 1 choosen stats that you want it cost 4 elixir to made 1 goblet it just a scam. I just don't know what to say but its so greedy every player f2p just like get scam"
"I play this game since first launch, the game contents getting depleted time by time. the gap period between patches is too long and lack of game features compared to other gacha games these days. it's the time for me to say goodbye to this game. tbh, i believe genshin will be a dead game within 5 years from now"
Waw
Nice going
Good üëç
One the best game you can play it's been more than 3 years since I started this game and i still love it .
"I love this game so much! And I just got LvL 90 Mualani on my ps4 and she is AMAZING! There are many other powerful characters here too! Just pick the one that suits you and you're amazing! I just got an Arlecchino, and she's very strong!!!"
Nothing to say best adventure
Best mobile game in my opinion
"I love this game, I can play it all day"
Nice game ü•∞
Wow üò≤
Add a skip button.
The new event is too hard to complete unless you pay to win
Dev never listen
It takes long to load!!
This game has gotten bad and has been treating its player base poorly sad to see but this game only cares about them getting money and doesn't care about their player base
Too much space lost Edit : I couldn't try it because when I started it asked me to download a very big sized file which my phone can't handle
"Can't understand why so much negativity towards the game. Really fun & intuitive, movement is smooth as is the combat, easy to pick up but challenging to master. Graphics are nice, land is expansive encouraging exploration, quests are engaging, character design is charming all having unique animations & personalities. Varied loot making it a rewarding play. Yes there are gacha elements but you don't have to pay 2 enjoy the game. My one gripe is I wish the camera stayed zoomed in when I zoomed in"
"QoLs behind characters. 45/55% lie. Natlan story so bad. No skip button, no loadouts. Farm by days. Devs not listening to global, only to China"
"Please do something with mute characters in the story, its been more than 8 months, I'm tired of that thing"
The game just needs more male characters
Pity system is suck
"Been playing since launch, changed my rating because of how bad the progression of the quality of life updates and overall updates are for the game, especially how farming artifacts still sucks, and even when 4 years have passed and a large number of players wanting this feature, artifact loudouts are still not in the game. The game is still nice, but could literally be better, if the Devs really look and work on a lot of the ideas and fixes that the players have suggested and sent to feedback."
Dawei may cryüî•üî•üî•
Money hungry company
Good choice for the game
Love is Genshin
paimon is very cute
Recently I couldn't open the app as it says that there is a bug in the app itself. I hope you could help resolve this issue. Thanks.
It's like never ends!
"I used to love this game, but since the release of Natlan, it has become absolute garbage. The new designs are all over the place & do not fit into the world of Teyvat. Natlan is partially based on Africa, yet they refuse to include characters with dark skin. The writing has become atrocious & the new characters are just cheap eye candy with the depth of a cardboard cutout. The game has also completely turned into waifu fanservice. Events are now geared towards specific units and aren't fun."
"I really recommend this game, especially to people who are yearning for a sense of adventure, the graphics and animations are stunning and the gameplay is remarkable, totes recommend"
The newest update storyline have almost no voicelines in English. Natlan is the most disappointing region because of that. There is a lot of quality of life Genshin can implement but will take years to do it because whoever is the top developers have too much pride to make any changes. So it is the same old grind... takes way longer to do dailies than it needs to. For a game that wants to develop its story super slow and drag it for years... the least they can do it make better events!
"genshin will always have a special place in my heart, but yeah nobody likes natlan, me included"
Kept getting connection timed out since returning to Australia even when my internet was working fine. Couldn't even play the game. It works fine when I went to Asia. I guess I will need to drop the game after so long.
"While QOL updates have been great, new characters and story in Natlan has gotten so much worse."
Best mobile game
What do we in this game but it is good
"Can I give this zero stars? How is it even fair to allow controller support for IOS only. Still push out new content but never add this one thing that would make the game actually playable on Android. It's like wow, you guys must really enjoy missing out on a huge player base."
Character designs became baaad
It's nice good story nice animation and good graphics
"this is greatest game in my whole life. game, graphics, story all things in this is great. i play this game in one month but i am not find any bugs or glitch in this game. salute hai bhai developer ko, love from uttarpradesh, india‚ô•Ô∏è"
Just skip button already..
Yeah pretty good game btw.üëç
perfect
The game is Amazing
it was good on mobile but on Chromebook it sed updata on 2 games that is copy fix this\
"Gileeee jujur ni gane keren bgtt, dari segi grafik, musik, dn model karakter... Cuma sekarang lagi ga dikasih napas dulu ya wkwkwkwk"
Nice game
"trash main story reward , the story reward really give nothing primo"
Im a newbie in the game but I really love this game so much!
I lik dis game
Super fun!
For Natlan(((
This is unplayable without controller support
"Game is very nice. But the rewards, the main character and free characters are very very underwhelming( feels like they deliberately nerfed them and main character doesn't feel like it) , the artifacts farming and getting proper stats as f2p takes years or even decades( I felt like that, if you don't spend tons of money). This game don't care about f2p players, they only focus on cash grabbing. And Combat is not intresting, it's like children game."
Super lag!
This is good open world game you should try it
It feels good üòä
Its so funn
Best game
Great one
loading takes 1 billion years
The game was good
"the game was fantastic and incredible. unfortunately, a few years later, when i change my phone i couldn't download the game again cuz it says that my phone isn't compatible with the game, although i have a lot of space in my phone storage."
This game on pc is amazing very once you explore the world it's very beautiful and very big and so many things to do.
"The coolest game I ever seen I like it very very much but I his game was a powerful game and it need 34 GB so , that's only problem"
"I really Love the game, Hello again! Hope your all doing well so i got a suggestion that your game should add a recognition like when you login in from the same device you should suggest that ""login this account?"" Option,Thanks, bebo"
these current updates are trash annoying events. chaska riding big ridiculous looking guns which doesn't suit the game aesthetic. mauvika riding motorcycles ruins genshin game aesthetic. it's getting worst day by day. it's official that i completely HATE genshin impact. bunshin phantasm and those other events it's garbage üóëÔ∏è this game doesn't deserve 1* Realm of Tempered Valor event completely unfair and only for natlan units and most of the team vary rotation time & duration is only 30sec. üóëÔ∏è
üëç the game's graphics are good smooth
"EDIT: Genshin used to be a good game for casuals with a great story before Natlan - if you dislike having certain mechanics & charas shoved down your throat now to clear endgame content & some events (nightsoul everything >.<) instead of being able to use your faves, maybe only play until Fontaine for the plot then feel free to ignore mhy's worsening habits. Personally I do still play but no longer pay for the gacha out of disgust at the powercreeping & ridiculous amounts of waifu fanservice :/"
great great game!
I just like this type of games
Been getting error codes more often than I go to school
"don't waste your time, this game is dying anyway."
"This game is my life and soul, the details, the story, the lore, it's simply amazing , its like this game was made for me, the voice acting is good, I like the lore and the map exploration the most, designs and backstory are very nice, I love the creepy lore very much, it just makes my mind feel at ease, I enjoy playing this game a lot, 100% would recommend, although they tend to have some issues lately, it doesn't bother me at all, I love the music and harmony very much, very very outstandingüî•"
Visuals are soo freakin good ‚òÜ
Extra files 31 GB damn
Best game I ever seen ü´°
LOVE IT!!!
Nice experience
"A peaceful world where I can glide freely, throughout Heaven and Earth ‚úçÔ∏èüçÅ"
my fav forever
I like the ghaphics
"I can no longer give 5 stars to genshin. Every day, they prove how much they dont care about their player base. 5.4 is the worst patch of any game I've ever played in my entire life. Banners are poop. Events were clearly made by 4 year olds. Honestly, I never thought I'd passionately hate something so much. But i legitimately HATE this game now. You can tell how much they care about us with their 3.3 rating while wuthering waves does everything to make their players happy and sitting at 4.6."
this game is awesome
lagi bagus kalau ada button skip.
Best game in battle for day
Gameplay is amazing
"Sinked in more than 4000 hours by now, so it speaks for itself. There 1000s of gacha games out there but regardless of the ratings(if you are playing this for the 2 time you'll only see then so late) you will not find a better game than this in the high Fantasy, action RPG, gacha space."
Best open world game on mobile
World number one game
Where the heck are the voice actors hoyoverse ? Do something about this AI non-sens
Absolute Cinema I have nothing to say abt this game!
"Too much talking, simple animation, lazy art, nonsense yapping game"
Very sigma
I hate the part when you're new users and you need to wait a long hours just to play because the recourses would take a long hour to download.
"[since '24] GALAXY S21 U< Gorgeous Visuals, Animation, Lore & Story!

I hate the new fan services. C'mon it's that hard making a man? üíÄüíÄüíÄ
Cool
"I would give this game 3 stars if I based my review off personal preference, and I would give it 5 stars if it had no greedy pay-to-win mechanics. Do not let the internet make you hate this. Also, they're not temples, they're dungeons. Also, if you play this for the exploring and fighting, PLAY THE BINDING OF ISAAC!!!"
Good game but take a lot of storage
Locking some events for specific characters isn't a good move ...i didn't like natlan characters design so i didn't pull for them to find out that i can't get events rewards when i don't specific teams ... rating you 00 and im not paying another dollar to this game that doesn't respect their players choice
I've been playing this game since the beginning and as much as I love it the fan service has become a bit too much and I'm starting to not like Genshin as much. I really wish Genshin would go back to the way it was in the beginning with the fantasy feel too it.
Easily the best open-world action mobile game there is
Really good game probably the first best mobile anime rpg every other is trash the story is good same for Carectors and UI the grafics are gorgeous the animations fire and the open world I'm sold although I hope there'll be multi-player in the game not just co-op
Game startup too slow
Nice..!
Best game
"I don't like the fact that there is little range of skin tones, though. Lots of people have spoken up about it, but we still haven't seen any dark-skinned characters. I do know that Hoyoverse is a Chinese company, so but other east asian owned games (dislyte, ect.) actually have dark skin. The only dark skinned characters we have are enemies and npcs. Please,for the love of everything, ADD A SKIP BUTTON."
Very good and fun to play
Genshin >>>>>
Love it
ok
Love this game sooo much... But PLEASE bring out controller support for Android phones!!!
"This game is best, that's all I want to say"
‚ù§Ô∏è
I like the game the open world experience
"played for 4 years and donated stably, got interesting characters and was happy, closed the abyss with different packs. I really liked the event for natlan characters and the complete lack of opportunity to get a card. I will never donate again"
It a really good good game bro
I really like the stories and exploring the map though overtime the monsters got harder and harder and I couldn't even finish the story quest luckily there are players that are willing to give tips and help me out ü•π (edit: after 250 I like ittttt my luck is so bad tho)
"A next level mobile rpg game, MUST TRY!!!!!!!!!!!!!! !! Edit: from 5* to 1*. As a v1.0 player I think I have reached my peak, everything keeps repeating and it goes on and on every update, storyline is boring, same old sequence since the very first nation but different scenarios. Also, powercreep is getting worse, favoring only the new characters with thier different combat mechanics making my old favorite characters irrelevant to the new content and events, not worth the money I spent anymore"
Great graphics
30GB?........
"It's a very enjoyable game! I like the story and the characters; the graphics are amazing and the music is calming and relaxing. But the updates take too much storage so I ended up deleting the game because I don't have a enough storage. If you could make downloading updates voluntary so that when a player finishes a part of the game, he can delete it and download some of the updates as much as his storage permits. It's better than forcing players to download updates in one go in order to play."
I didn't play it yet but I'm so excited üòÜ ü§ó
"Beautiful game, beautiful graphics, new gameplay unlocked, pretty sounds of weather and character..."
How nice this game are
Niceü§©ü§©ü§©
I really love the game and it story's and all the archon story(for anyone who doesn't know archons are gods) I love the base of the game and I play both on mobile and PlayStation I do say I wish there was as much graphics that could be generated on phone as on playstation for example the Visual affects aren't as efficient on phone (mine atleast) but otherwise on playstation the graphics and the game are both so amazing the grinding and pulling system are abit tough but otherwise it's beautiful
"This is the first time I'm leaving a bad review for a game. That's how much it sucks. It starts off great but eventually it burns you out with all the grind, making it feel like work rather than fun. Even the dialogues are unnecessarily long, boring and can't be skipped. Everything is RNG/time gated. The new area update brought with it new server issues on top of everything else. People have been complaining about these and more for years now, but they never listen to us. Can not recommend."
Didn't improve a single bit since I played it the first time. I'm tired.
"Takes up too much storage, gooner game"
Good game Not recommended for 32gb ram or low device üôÇ
Nice game
"Takes up way to much storage but that's reasonable for a game with graphics like this, I'm just kinda disappointed with the whe natlan thing other than that it's overall a pretty decent game with good graphics"
Amazing game but deserve one star in case of listening players
"the game is bad in a lot of aspects, honestly I only play it for my favorite characters at this point"
This game almost Pay To Winüëéüëéüëéüëé
I just play because want pull furinaü´¶
the diversity is bad
one of my favorite gsmes
Nice gme
The gaming experience would be more awesome if it support game pad or joystick.

"once long ago, this game used to be the best mobile game ever. Now the dev company is so out of touch with the playerbase, the game turned into something different and unfamiliar, not even a shadow of it's former self. Wuthering Waves does everything Genshin can, could, or even dream of, but way better."
"This game is amazing! The graphics, the nations all so cool!!!"
gud
This game beat gta 6 very soon üíÄ
It's a wonderful game of open World
Good
Its a very nice game
Pimon does not shut up
Dev's need improvement first before the game
It's a good game
"Goodgame, wish i can get furina tho."
I've play this like since 2.0 and i get back like recently and there's still no quality of life
"The HP of bosses and enemies have gotten outrageously high each major update because that's the only to make this game ""challenging"" and the new event clearly proves that."
Such a fun game!
Unnecessarily high spec. Why is yhe loading time this long
Man this game sure has a toxic fanbase and get bullied alot but I still play this game because it's fun well this game got abit outdated because got a big competition like wuthering waves but still I don't mind I play both games because both is good and please listen to player recommendation to improve the game alright
cool characters would like lyney to come back üî•üòãüôè
This was a nice game Graphic was awesome
Nice üëç
"well, Genshin was a good game. WAS. until Natlan. I don't want to repeat all other negative reviews: design, map, style, NEW CHARACTERS ESPECIALLY (veresa?! are u joking?), only sexualized woman now (YOU SAW MUALANI CLOTHES? Me neither). gameplay pretty cool, but lack of balance. too hard to get artifacts or 20 primos, but too much powercrept characters. (and have u seen the new event? sorry, but who without maviuka c6 can clear it?)"
"Id love to say ur game is good but theres one thing that is pissing me off when i send verification code its late on delivered and thats when i thought it wasnt working so i tried resend and still not work then i tried again and over again then finally it delivered the FIRST one now i have to wait for the rest. Please fix this glitch,i dont know if im the only one who got in that way bc my bro also got in that way too."
Aku benar benar suka dengan storynya^^
ok
A scam business.. repetitive gameplay from 1.0 till now.. bad marketing to bring old players back.. not enough to gain trust
wuthering waves are better than genshin impact.
This game is goooodüòç
üëç
The stars I gave bcs how much I hate Realm of Tempered Valor and Natlan.
Amazing
When you feel lonely or depressed this game is the best to play because if in future vr are get upgraded and they will be able to play genshin impact in that it would be like a dream and it is wonderful experience üòÄ ‚ò∫Ô∏è
Amazing
"it's hard to login with email or twitter, the loading take to long >:("
I love it
WW is better
"Insanely good graphics, slick controls, easy button remaps and nice minimalist UI"
"Game is horrible, 5 years and no development towards improving QoL, character design, ignoring players demands and gameplay/story worsening. Not even Dawei's tears can make me go back to this toxic dump, enjoy your ""revenue"" being used to buy another nuclear reactor."
Why genshin become lost connection the internet was fine
"Genshin Impact's ""Realm of Tempered Valor"" event was absolute trash. The ridiculous requirement to use only Natlan characters is a money grab, just forcing you to pull for those characters. And all the Nightsoul stuff felt so repetitive; it's like they just recycled their bosses and events. Natlan characters are absolutely terrible, with boring and repetitive gameplay. They just keep shoving them in our faces at every turn, which is making players feel like they don't even want to pull for them."
"Been playing for 4 years, it was very fun those days before Natlan even released. Ever since Natlan release I've had Soo many disappointment towards genshin. Character design and even story development is just boring. Now it's just full of fan service. Just female characters being released and no male had been released yet. Just by looking at the current situation there's no chance of more male being playable"
The game is really immersive and the characters is very good
budhal semangat moleh kendat
Genshin impact team pls add arlecchino on banner pls request sir I love this game this is my first game in spent more time. pls sir add arlecchino on banner.
"While the visuals are pretty, the very essence of the game design is completely wrong. You get goaded into spending real life cash to build a nice team to play with your friends. But by the time the game ""Allows"" you to play multiplayer mode, you realize the multiplayer mode is extremely punishing to the player being invited to the host's game as they don't benefit from anything besides a marginal part of the experience gained by killing monsters. No treasure, no game progression. What a waste.."
"love this game but it doesn't work on most devices & yes I see y'all are saying it kicks you they cant fix it it'sbc that your computer can handle the storage or something like that so wait till you get a high quality computer, the game has high graphics and tons of features which means you need lots of storage I haven't been able to play in over 1 year am I upset? yes, but I need to focus on school, and when I do have a good computer I'll play it but always 5 stars. great graphics & charaters"
"""Realm Of Tempered Valor"" Is Locked Behind Paywall I Don't Even Have Any Five Star Natlan Characters To Complete The Event To Get That Limited Time Award ""Name Card""."
Great Graphics. one of the best game I had ever played üíô
"I generally detest mobile games, but I've had a genuinely gun time playing Genshin Impact! It definitely borrows from breath of the Wild, but the characters are fun, smartly designed, and all-around likeable. You can play through the main story without ever spending a dime, no exaggeration. The best value if you do end up playing everyday is to buy the monthly pass, which gives you extra resources that allow for great unlocks. Grinding is mainly for upgrading character skills, and not too bad."
Worst game I have ever played
HOYOVERSE. WHERE ALL THE MALE CHARACTERS ARE
is game is the best of all
I love this game!! I've been playing this for years and it's really good if you like open world games. The design of each character and region is amazing! the music is also really good as well as the storylines.
I like it!
"The game isn't fun anymore, the amount of female characters are insane compared to male characters. The lack of lore dropping and excitements to the game after archon quests and the ""sticking to our guns"" was outdated now. It's not as fun as the first time. üòû"
This game is so far the best and the graphics on this is top quality but then if the game is better off from my expirenence why give it a 1 star rating? well majority of playable devices is so limited having no access of downloading this on a Redmi A3 device is kinda unfair though I played this from a computer so it's not really a big deal but again please optimize your game so that not only me but alot of people can play this on other devices that can't download this game thank you hoyoverse
goonerbait game.
Simply beautiful
Not working on new device.
bu fanlar niye boyle
It is my favorite game. When I am bored or have free time I play it. It's very fun. And my most favorite part is when I wish and get a new character‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ú®‚ú®
"The game became quite boring for me, especially for a player who is comfortable with their level. The Natlan quest wasn't really as exciting in the beginning and even before then there was issues. Once you've finished the story quests, everything just became boring. But the Natlan characters, as cool as they are, they just don't feel the same as the other nations. Also the mechanic in Natlan where you NEED Natlan characters for certain enemies, just put me off. So thank you for the journey."
Wow
Recently the game is forcing you to get the newest characters with new mechanics or you won't be able to complete events and challenges
