"My personal experience on mobile has been great. i love the combat, and the story is interesting and captivates me while playing, and i also love the character designs and the world is beautiful and has great scenery and is fun to explore it's a great game, and I would 100% recommend it...

They barely release any male characters, and i hope they will balance it out with the characters and stop doing too much fanservice.",my personal experience on mobile has been great i love the combat and the story is interesting and captivates me while playing and i also love the character designs and the world is beautiful and has great scenery and is fun to explore its a great game and i would 100 recommend it but it has wayyyyy too much fanservice they barely release any male characters and i hope they will balance it out with the characters and stop doing too much fanservice,1

"A beautiful world ruined by lackluster character interactions that are very one-dimensional due to employing the cliche trope of the main character being a hero and a loverboy.

Good game play. Nice story teller. Graphic is very good for mobile game level but does not support some laptop GPUs. The gacha rate is normally bad and understandable. If they remove 50/50 pity's rate that should be better. Normally you should get a 5 star banner character within 160 pulls(80 guarantee drop 2 times). Don't expect too much for a F2P player. Just play and enjoy your life. Another good thing is this game reminds you that you spend too much time in the game and should rest.,good game play nice story teller graphic is very good for mobile game level but does not support some laptop gpus the gacha rate is normally bad and understandable if they remove 5050 pitys rate that should be better normally you should get a 5 star banner character within 160 pulls80 guarantee drop 2 times dont expect too much for a f2p player just play and enjoy your life another good thing is this game reminds you that you spend too much time in the game and should rest,1

The 1st anniversary livestream is very lackluster. The reward is just a regular patch update with 10 more pulls or more? And they did it along with 10 rerun banners of great characters and 2 characters that is loved by players plus skins. Like they aim to milk the players dry of their wallet. I truly love this game and even spent a bit even though I spent rarely in games but if this is how they treat their players then even I won't tolerate this.

The graphics are great and the story is mostly interesting with some great character designs (the camel toe on the latest character when her outfit gets wet is vile and I wish I could unsee it). The problem lies with the game dissolving into yet another hideously dull harem fantasy.

"Whatever you guys did with Rinascita. Keep that up and surpass it.

It's clear you won't stop with rover harem reducing all female characters to just another fanservice. Atleast don't sexualize youthful and mentally unstable and the easily manipulated trope in sexualized clothes as camellya. Make as many waifus but don't put characters like camellya and katixia in the story or give us an option to avoid such things. Pheobe for example is fine because she's youthful but clothed. Carlotta is fine too because she seems well put together and not too revealing,its clear you wont stop with rover harem reducing all female characters to just another fanservice atleast dont sexualize youthful and mentally unstable and the easily manipulated trope in sexualized clothes as camellya make as many waifus but dont put characters like camellya and katixia in the story or give us an option to avoid such things pheobe for example is fine because shes youthful but clothed carlotta is fine too because she seems well put together and not too revealing,0

"it was a nice game overall from the gameplay to the quality of life system that help the player. the only concern that i have as a player is way to earn more funding for the gacha to get the new characters as i don't spend money at all. aside from the story, event, map exploration. which is plenty bountiful if i say. but after the story/event/map is cleared i don't see a way for casual player which maybe or not play just for a few minutes or hour to get more of the fund for gacha.",it was a nice game overall from the gameplay to the quality of life system that help the player the only concern that i have as a player is way to earn more funding for the gacha to get the new characters as i dont spend money at all aside from the story event map exploration which is plenty bountiful if i say but after the storyeventmap is cleared i dont see a way for casual player which maybe or not play just for a few minutes or hour to get more of the fund for gacha,1

"The best game in my opinion, and definitely a breath of fresh air after Genshin. I love the gameplay, and I love the mechanics. The characters might need a bit more work, but the diverse animations and the lore really made up for it. I don't mind female playable characters, but I do wish there's more male characters.
