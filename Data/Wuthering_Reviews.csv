Review
i own a samsung s23 fe but even though I can't enjoy this game on 60 fps it's laggy in my phone but if u have a nice gaming phone then it will be a great game
Peak
I love it...
"My personal experience on mobile has been great. i love the combat, and the story is interesting and captivates me while playing, and i also love the character designs and the world is beautiful and has great scenery and is fun to explore it's a great game, and I would 100% recommend it... BUT! it has WAYYYYY too much fanservice. They barely release any male characters, and i hope they will balance it out with the characters and stop doing too much fanservice."
Dang it this 2.3 is worse my Aalto gameplay can't feel it
best anime gameü§óü§ó
damn it's good
amazing!! always blessings by Kuro Games!!!!
Best gacha. Just add more male characters for once
"Happy First Year Anniversary Wuthering Waves. Very happy to be a part of this game since the very first update. In my opinion the best gacha game I've ever played. Very highly recommend. Personally I'd probably continue to play this game for a very long time. Don't listen to the criticism online, most of them are just greedy and ungrateful for what the game has to offer."
Absolutely love this game. amazing anniversary enjoyed every minute of play very generous rewards
the beggining was sad af
What Happened? After Update it is completely crash and black screen like pixelate. Help fix this.
"Been having alot of fun in this game. combat is great, love that it has cross platform progression so I can play on pc, psn and pc. it's definitely a gotcha game but tastefully done."
the best and easy to get 5 star characters..
good üëç
üòò
"I like this game too, my brother told me to play this game when he's planning on playing it too, the character's voice, design and stories are good. But I recommend you to play this on a good phone, pc or any good devices that can handle this game!! :'D"
don't know why but the game crashes on my Samsung s20 FE UW snapdragon 865 can u help my issue please
üëç
not bad with the controller supported üëå but kinda expensive not enough good deal or more stuff in the game
please fix lag
love it!
love this game
Always losing 50:50. You guys should at least make the anniversary banner better like 100% win the character u selected or lose to a random anniversary banner character.
Game beautiful but game laggy after anniversary update :( very sad :( Can't play properly like before :(
been playing since the games release it's clear they only care about new players or returning players. I also haven't won a single 50/50 since release. I won't be wasting my time on a game that doesn't care about consistent players.
"I love the game but there are too many females I'm not saying that I don't like but there's not enough male characters, I suggest putting more male characters to the game and pls do not make the male characters gay I'm not saying that I'm homophobic, this is just my opinion"
I have been playing this game since it was released and i still find it entertaining and fun but one thing i want is that i want more male characters
"amazing graphics. I'm disappointed in the anniversary, but that is my opinion, and anyone reading this shouldn't take that as a reason to not play. For a free game, this is incredible. 3 stars because I lost my 50/50 3 times Also I understand that im the minority, and I also understand that this is a part of how you sell your game, but I have continuously asked for an option to turn off jiggle physics. I know that most of the community appreciates it, but pleaseeeee give me an option!!! :("
cool game baik
I LOVE U SO BAD
"Even after many updates, the game is still not optimized, my redmagic 9 pro heats up even in low settings, still a great game, I hope they optimize it."
Well done! kuro. You did phenomenal job with 2.0 and Anniversary. Hoping for more great things to come
the game it self is amazing
"The game is slowly but steadily turning into Genshin Impact. The anniversary is absolutely terrible; instead of giving back to the players for their support, they're asking for more money. Greed is ruining this game."
"I really but really like this game, yet it always crushes on my phone. I want to play it on my phone but it doesnt even let me play for 5 mins. It always starts to lag and then the game completely crushes. It's probably about optimization. Please do something about it!"
man I was shocked in the resources hahahhahaha
"Great EN VA for latest character,love it."
So sad seeing ts game become a harem
"I love this game! Beautiful graphics, amazing gameplay, and awesome characters. it's just the storage."
lackluster anniversary.
"I previously rated as 5 stars, but the game always crash and lag after each update. nowadays, if I want to exit the game, I just need to open the announcement icon as an alternative way to exit the game, free game crash Compared to last time, the crash is way worse: I can even crash just from scrolling the event page."
not fun with gacha system.
i can't describe this just another masterpiece.
"I want to play your game, but every time it crashes so I thought about having some space storage in my phone, but it doesn't work, it stills crashing , I used the clear patch options and it doesn't work so I don't know what to do to enjoy the game , I don't know to play it in a computer and I don't have one (laptop) and I've an old version of an iPad so not enough storage thank though for the experience. I love everything about the game"
"A beautiful world ruined by lackluster character interactions that are very one-dimensional due to employing the cliche trope of the main character being a hero and a loverboy. The devs have incredibly become more greedy with their monetization, which has seeped into character kits not being able to be fully utilized without relying on other characters that are also from the limited banners from previous patches. I do not recommend this gacha game to anyone, play a real game instead."
incel cesspool
"Making Zani dependable of Phoebe for extra Spectro damage is quite an evil thing to do. I pulled Zani twice, got her signature weapon, and threw quite good echoes on her but still she feels so clunky and deals trash damage compared to my other units that are less reliable than her. I don't want to pull 1 character and for it to unlock its full potential I have to get its weapon, all their copies, 3 support characters, kill 1000 birds, run from one corner of the map to another."
Very nice game
"its a good game so far, but it is wayyy too laggy on my phone."
lost five times in a row ....
A perfect game as an RPG and openworld but please no more female new cheracters
"Honestly I like the character designs but it's just something bothering me, it's about the jiggles even though the characters is flat. I'm still giving 5 star"
"Horrible gender ratio, unnecessary forced romance, be better."
"Misogynistic, sexist, objectifying women. That's all this game is. If you're coming here for a good time, back out, unless you're the fandom who loves to just sexualize women and do nothing of importance. I played this game since release, and I'm tired of it. The devs censored a female because her design was skimpy, the fandom begged for it to be uncensored and the devs listened. Meanwhile, a male character was censored while he showed no skin, and they never uncensor his despite being begged."
"i really like the game but it's just starting to feel like any other gatcha, the devs are becoming more and more greedy and the anniversary rewards are just as bad as the genshin and hsr ones. i really hoped that they would actually give more than just some free pulls but i guess it's better to make money than to repsect your player base. update, the anniversary rewards are even WORSE then what they could've been, this game is a fan service joke at besteüíÄüíÄ"
"I ABSOLUTELY LOVE IT! Sure It has bugs, but considering that it's only starting and has room for fixes, it's actually really really good! Love the mechanics, especially the movements. as an rpg player this actually brought a new feel to me. Thank you and Keep up the good work!"
It's becoming like Genshin
"idc what ppl says, it's a great game always ü•∞‚ù§Ô∏è"
best game so far
very fun and good mechanics
really good game .
i love u kurooo ü•∞ü•∞ makasih udah buat game se gacor ini genshin kalah jauh
nicesuuu
"I am sad I fail all new character with high pity ,the feeling from by f2p"
"Wuthering Waves is a stunning action RPG that delivers on every front. Its breathtaking visuals, smooth combat, and emotional storytelling create an unforgettable experience. The world feels alive, the characters are unique and fun to master, and the soundtrack perfectly heightens every moment. With its deep themes of hope and resilience, Wuthering Waves sets a new benchmark for the genre‚Äîa must-play for any RPG fan."

"The game is Very Awesome . Maybe it has a lot of problems on its first launch, but by the time passes you can notice some of the optimizations of the game which you can tell that kuro games cares for its players. Keep up the hard work, Kuro!"
"Love the game but censorship is so annoying Edit: 1st anniversary was a spit in the face. Rating dropped to 1. Edit 2: Some stuff has been improved, back to 3"
"got lucky haha, thanks!"
no words needed this is definitely the best game I've ever played ...since I play genshin ...I love how the designed their characters and the combat system is just good love it
"This is by far one of the most cleanest games I've played in awhile! The Storyline is so thrilling while also pulling at the heart strings! Not only that but, the combat is so well made! Every Character has their own unique combat system, via combos and dodge mechanics! Events of plenty and even fair to f2players! The exploration is absolutely stress free and beautiful!! The only downside so far is the imbalance of 4 stars to 5 stars! Other than that, I'm proud to say I'm apart of this story!!"
help I can't open the game and I can't click on the game screen for no reason.
lovely game
"More often than not the devs do listen, sometimes a little too much to the point the community explodes when expectations are or aren't met. Objectively though the game is amazing in many regards, it won't be appealing to certain people but that's just a problem that comes with every game. Each patch is an improvement on the overall quality of the game its just the management of their PR need improvement. Communication between devs and players are good it's really just PR and the community."
Love your games kuro keep it up I've been playing wuthering waves for a while now and all I can say is it is a good game free to play friendly and gives a lot of reward to the players kuro has been very generous in all they're games I played a lot of pgr before too and I can say that both pgr and wuthering waves are a very good game and wuthering waves is the best game I've played so far from this last few years thankyou for making a wonderful game kuro keep it up
zani for a better life.
Sad they focus on monetization during the anniversary. Should've seen the red flag when they only release 2 new 4-star & gave negative status effects to newer units only.
love the story and game design so much
"I was wrong, this game has become so good since its first release."
"bad anniversary, no kompensasi"
"would be an amazing game, but my experience has been horrendous. I lost my account two times, even when I logged in with the same email and everything. I had finally managed to get a good team, and now I'm supposed to start over because my info has been apparently wiped?"
cool
just amazing graphics I'm speechless
super laggy even on a device that runs everything else smoothly on full graphics (GI ; PGR ; Infinity Nikki ; etc...)
Return to the game got new 5 star character and new weapon
"The game can survive without service, in case you didn't know. I wish there were more male characters. Deducted for excessive service and not having my language. You probably won't care about small comments like this."
"1st anniversary rewards are a disappointment to the loyal player base, but the game is very good. (might change the rating if the dev actually listens)."
it's one of the best games with good dev team but the mobile optimization is bad for this game it needs more rendering distance for sure
"I really love this game, but it becomes too boring when you see that the characters are really boring and they don't interact with each other and only communicate with Rover. This is sad actually. Literally every character tried to flirt with Rover. I think most of the fandom will agree that this harem around Rover is boring and we would like to see more character development and not harem development and these kind of romantic 'relationships'. This game has great potential but alas("
Amazing game and gameplay. But Why evey update I have to redownload the huge game files??!
!ncels game
"Very Good Storyline and Fighting but definitely needs more main storyline content since it feels like the main story can just be finished within 1 week and most of the content is side quests so pls add more Main Storyline Content and definitely needs more cutscenes since those definitely make the story more memorable like the cutscenes in the rinascita and also more free rewards since it is kinda hard to get new characters,and very hard to farm leveling and ascension materials as a newbie"
one star only for game optimizations. This game needs more optimization than rewards or content
it's a very good game but it's kinda laggy on my low end phone. can make it run to a low end phone and can I adjust the range that loads like genshin impact you make 3d to 2d in further area to miniature the lag ü§î
the graphics of the game were good but my phone can't handle it and I can't play anymore because it's showing only black screen.
"2.3 patch aka Anniversary... right now it's pretty much underwhelming, like I can feel there's something missing that I couldn't quite put my finger on. The optimizations are good, and I don't know why some of them still have ""Lag"" and ""Bugs"" when it's been slowly got fixed for several patches now, sounds fishy ngl... just upgrade your phone or better option is buy a console or pc.üòí Anyways... I do hope that the second phase is good."
"Amazing game, looks great, plays great, story and chars are great, on PS5 as well. Highly recommend it."
super
horrible game. never make an account. been trying to unsubscribe from their email lists and they dont stop sending emails. all these 5* reviews are FAKE.
it's a good game. just the lag is bad. Edit: no way you guys are always adding girls are you guys h*rny?
"This whole 12 banner thing just left a sour taste in my mouth. it really felt like a reality check, to realize that kuro is still a gacha company all this time. The game is not bad by any means, it's actually really good, there's a lot of fun to be had, it's just that this anniversary felt more like a way to reel in new players and whales. This patch deadass feels like a normal patch in terms of rewards. Still love the game, I don't hate it, but highly dissapointed. Don't become like hoyo, pls!"
Your anniversary update is suck. Needs 18GB++ and if the wifi is not great it's always failed to download. I still can't play it since your last anniversary update
i love it
There is a bug limiting frame rate to 30 when in dialogue even though my frame rate limit is set to 60. Level of detail adjustments are too aggressive making everything look like a blurry mess.
"Hello and congratulations to the kuro game team for their great game Wuthering Waves. Your game is very interesting and entertaining. But unfortunately, by censoring some things, some segments of the players will be offended. If possible, add an option that those who want to move the game forward with or without censorship can choose. This solution is the best solution for everyone. Please take the time to read this message. Thank you and your great team."
"I love this game ngl, the parry/dodges feels so satisfying I got addicted to playing since 1.0. Updates came in then my laptop can't handle it anymore so I switched to my phone. Then the recent update (zani) completely broke my phone for some reason. Idk, I am pretty sure my phone can handle wuwa just fine because I can use medium graphics during the last patches but this recent patch made the game completely unplayable üò≠ Update: The game works on my phone now~"
After the update the game crashes frequently
"Keren banget sih ini game, apalagi setelah version 2.2, gila sih ini game gacha terbaik yang pernah gw mainin buat saat ini"
"Love the game, the gameplay, and almost everything about it. It's just disappointing that the direction of character diversity is predictable. Thus far, significantly less males are being released along with an increasing highlight in female sexualization. I hope that what you have advertised at the game release would have been followed, but alas, the game is slowly but surely leaning in THAT direction. Hope you take these character suggestions well as it kind of demotivates some. Kudos!"
Anniversary content and rewards are lackluster. not sure if Kuro or Tencent is behind being so stingy with players who saved this game. 2.3 DOESN'T EVENT HAVE A MAP UPDATE. Barely any male characters. 24 limited banners in 2.3 part 1 and 2 with NO guarantee to get the character. No free character or skin for anniversary. Not even a repeat of Xiangli Yao from last year for the PLAYSTATION community who missed out. Projection of the Somnoire Anchor from past event but it's not even a weapon? Weak.
Honestly my favorite game in history. I would appreciate more good male characters though.
"I jumped to wuwa from genshin , upgrade in every aspect. L natlan"
"please choose the male character during your first log in.... ,u won't regret like me and thank me later"
runs poorly and only got worse after update
"Hologram, it's not about your power, even money spend. it's all about just dodging until you get bored, not engaging on your combo and power. making this gacha thing nonsense. plus,even it's about dodge, you died in middle of Dodge Animation. 100% parry leave you in more vulnerable state and kill you."
"kuro game, I hope the wuthering waves game can lower the specifications of the game, so that players who play the mobile version, especially for mobile phones with medium and lower specifications, can play smoothly when playing the wuthering waves game. üôèPlease consider the short opinion that I convey to the kuro game developer, especially for the wuthering waves developer, thank you üôèüôè"
"please optimize the graphics of this game I had to uninstall after downloading 22Gb data for this game this was an huge waste of my time and data pack, plz fix the graphic blurr, and crashing issues"
i love you Kuro. Update: Anniversary is pretty underwhelming. Not 1/10 bad but 4/10 bad. It's just such a disappointing anniversary event as it feels like a regular patch with just a bit of flare and a fancy title.
amazing game
awsome
"Tbh I expected this to pop off, but they completely out done themselves, Kuro you did a goodjob, The Lore and the way the story is focused on the Mc alone is Good aswell, Not everyone wants to be a camera man like some other gacha....GENSHIN WHO SAID THAT?! anyway Good stuff kuro"
this game is something else üî•
Amazing story
The game is good but eventually in higher device it can't run smoothly at high settings I mean I talk my phone have Qualcomm Snapdragon 888 but it only run the game at 45 FPS at high settings and I have 12 GB lpddr5x RAM so please just optimise because in lower or medium settings the game looks blurry or pixelated if the game is fully optimise the experience of the game is going insane so please developer fix it
I love this game luck
Game is very good. The fighting style is awesome
"The game is all good, I have seen the efforts put in by the developers, I want to say that the game should be optimised for somewhat low end devices, not everyone has space in pc to play games and in mobile it hangs somewhat at max settings"
game of The Year
"Maine Weathering Waves khela, aur sach batau toh graphics aur combat ne toh dil jeet liya‚Äîhar character unique feel hota hai, aur game ka atmosphere ekdum immersive hai. i love this game üòçüéÆ"

"Changing the review from 5 - 1* the devs don't care to listen anymore since they got plenty players now. Aniversary is horrible, events are just boring, it feels like a normal filler patch. The so called ""aniversary banner"" is nothing but a rerun banner. Even after so much uproar they didn't care to listen they just tossed some pulls and the game is getting more and more predatory , the current character Zani only works with specific 5 star. The pop-up in the battle pass is annoying as fk."
Game baiküòä
"kuro games if you guys are reading this please please please let me win my 50 50 it's been 3 banners since I started playing, I haven't won a single 50 50, and the worst case I'm hitting hard pity every single timeeeeee . Honestly i might quit this game if I lose my 5050 4 times in a row looking forward to it tbh if you guys are curious about whether this true or not please just check my wishing history or something üò≠ I wanted zani so bad guess I'll just farm more for her (anything for zani fr)"
"The modifier tab doesn't show up on my data bank, idk why"
"i love this game so much, the graphics, gameplay, mechanic, and especially the stories"

"I really liked this game. This game gives a lot of memories and gaming experience. But one of the reasons is that this game has a lot of lag especially when I go to the city, fighting events and many places. Kuro Game please fix this lag."
The game is very good and high quality but it need more male character.
this game is good the only reason the ratings low because of these brain dead genshin horny players
the VERY FIRST ANNIVERSARY is kinda disappointingüíîüòû
"Losing 50/50 4 times in a row with high pity, are you kidding me?"
The lag issues have been fixed after the 2.3 update now. But I really don't like the anniversary events. Give us more reward or a free 5 star selector. They even didn't remove the 50/50 from the anniversary banner. I just lost after wasting 80 pulls. How is this anniversary even better than any other patches. I'm switching my rating from 3 to 2. Make the anniversary better or I'm leaving.
Definitely great but I kept unstalling and installing it for my storage but I definitely recommend downloading it!!! :DD
"Not encouraging for mobile user's they priotizing alot in pc and console graphics design. In every update my phone deterioate even you got highest specs still having problem in the gameplay thats why I quit genshin impact because becoming unplayable later version. And this becoming competitive, I like it casual before but now they show it in this annivesary. Feeling not welcome anymore..."
nice game
i literally imajin me in the game
luv it
tq kuro

Lost 50/50 all the time and hard pity which is 75 most of the time. I hope I can give negative stars.

good animetion
Great.
"Is there a secret rule that every gacha needs to become extremely greedy and low quality past their 1st anniversary ? Game was a literal 10/10 last month and i'm close to selling off my 1yo account now. Even if we ignore the ridicilous rewards, the actual content is as boring as possible. Powercreep and -700% offers are next step apparently. Kuro becomes HoYo. Great."
"my rating was 5 star before but now I'm gonna give it 3 star the anniversary felt so underwhelming, I don't mind if they give so much stuff but it feels very awful. I understand why players are very disappointed in this patch. hopefully they will Fix this issue. but as of now if things keep doing down here. my rating will also go down and I may just Quit the games."
good
wasted potential they turned into a harem game full of fanservice 1.0-1.2 wuwa>>>>whatever it is right now
Good game
When will WUWA make Jinhsi's spectro Sub DPS resonator? Don't tell me about zhezhi because she is Carlotta sub DPS!
very bad anniversary reward.
I love this game I quit genshin now
absolute best game
dissapointing anniversary
"2025 you guys still complaining this game lagging.. owh come on guyss upgrade your device.. don't blame the game.. are you guys doesn't have money?? poor you..!! this game is good but your device is bad.. sooo don't blame the game!! kuro always upgrade to improving the game, so you guys must upgrade too.. you guys should also upgrade your devices, don't just keep complaining but not be aware of yourself that your device is poor!!! change your device!! snapdragon 8 gen 1,2,3 and elite!!"
"Wuwa has to fix this very issue. when I log back in as a returning player, it shows me or makes me choose to the two Rovers, and making restart everything I got, limited 5 stars, etc."
This game is Absolute Cinema
goated game
best gacha game I've ever played in my life.
Masterpiece
best
Awesome üëç
have to play this on console because my phone cant handle it but otherwise it is a really good game
THANK YOU SO MUCH FOR CONTROLLER SUPPORT. ü•∞ ADD: The game is getting better. credits to all the developers. Loved the new update. Saw all little improvements. EDIT: PLEASE ADD VR WITH CONTROLLER SUPPORT that would be a super surreal experience. the feeling of being part of the game ‚ô•Ô∏è
superb
not better than genshin impactüçóü¶¥
"only negative i have to say to this game is the gotcha system but overall, this is an awesome game w/ a great story and a jaw dropping graphics specially their character and weapon design, just pure delight"
best gacha game ever
"fix the Lag i can't combat, walk, turn the camera, or go through cutscenes or skipable dialogue playing on a new Samsung a16 (My other games take up more storage & I can play on the highest graphics with no lag) without it lagging to the point where the game is unplayable, I like the story & the game & really want to play with my friend fix the Lagggh"
"Trash anniversary, not only did koro not gave enough rewards for 11 banner. I also lost my 50/50just now at 80pity by the way like 80pity.as a free to play I am angry and sad at a anniversary like it is supposed to be a fun anniversary not these"
its good but has a lot of downloads
i love the developers and the game. update: me and a bunch of other players have been experiencing some crashes after 2.1
it nice..but.. hmm ... I can't say it because it my own opinion.. so yeah it's a good game to try.. hope my device still can support this game in the future.. Hahaha
nice
1. the lack of male character 2. the lack of 4 stars I am just disappointed
improve controls !!
"Wüî• Kuro Games you're cooking really good, every updates, 2.X characters and also the story areüî• together with the 1st anniversary. I'm really glad that I played this game. Kuro never disappointsüî•."
"game isn't optimised I was trying to play since version one on my phone which can run genshin on high but I can't play this game even on performance and everything on low, the game is really good but unplayable in combat, my phone doesn't support zenless zone zero but can play that game on default settings but wuwa can't please fix this"
"this game is lit, like i would literally rate it 10/10 because it is literally free & great map! and recommended for those who are not really interested in the story/lore and only play it for the battle. however, there were some issues that needed to be fixed, such as lagging, fps drop, battle opt., and so on. and, DIO MIO please add some MALE characters üôèüèº thanks ! !"
fire anniversary
love the game but the loading when you enter is low even if have a good network
"W game, one of the best alternate for genshin impact, this game is so good and my phone can handle it! The graphics are a win!"
This game is extremely good but quite boring because it takes so much time to farm for one character. The CRI RATE should be more easy to get. I only got ONE CRI RATE from a hundred CRI DMG. üò≠üò≠
game crashing after terms and conditions and I don't have an issue with other similar games
loved this game! so much fun to play recommend ‚ô•Ô∏è
2.3 is worst anniversary kuro have done
toa sentry construct is always in the air it's annoying
"I want to play and support this game, but it keeps crashing every time I try to open the game up. Sometimes, I don't even make it past the loading screen before it goes black and back to the home screen. I can't even get to the settings to change it. A game shouldn't be on the app store for devices you can't even play it on without crashing. I will change the review once it gets fixed, or they lower the framework for low-end devices"
"I love this game with my whole heart, but holy, the optimization on mobile is terrible. I've started playing on mobile in 2.0, everything worked fine. No lag, no freezes, no crashes. But every update after 2.0 makes it harder to play. Now I crash every 2 minutes. It's best to stick with PC."
Good üòä
"best game i ever played,before I played genshin impact when this game release I just tried this game i loved it and now I am addicted to this game , after release of this game i didn't play genshin impact because wuthering waves is better in everything"
"Damn kuros, yall really made fine games."
"As a new player, the rewards for the recent anniversary event are quite lackluster."
"recently picked this up hearing about the anniversary, and of course the events want you to already be at level 90. while that's understandable, catching up isn't fun, as pulls are few and far between unless you use the almighty credit card, which is all the devs seem to care about. exploration content feels more like a chore, and while the story was great for awhile, it peaked early and fell flat after the first big boss fight, and everything after that has been predictable and boring."
"the story is interesting, and the fight is so good and satisfying"
game baik
bad anniversary event and rewards
"Literally one of my comfort games that helped me through my depression, however I give it 4 stars since the sole reason why I started this game, aka Scar, isn't playable yet and thisngame recently only release females"
Took too long to open up and suddenly kicked me out of the app.
"very disappointed with how they worked on this new patch. first and the biggest L from Kuro, I believe they'll keep doing this moving forward, sadly."
"Gimped Zani just to sell Phoebe, disgusting behavior."
"i struggle to login into my accounts and wuwa didnt do anything about it, after one year they finally brought it back. graphics are good but the game eventually gets boring and repetitive, it feels like a big chore, unless they add new gameplay in their events, to top it all off their female characters are extremely sexualized, BUT it is also sometimes enjoyable depending on what youre doing"
"I played this game since day one, it was very fun at first, all fun and games, I got encore, Verena, jiyan. the game got too repetitive and boring, I was overloaded with quests and world exploration, took an huge break until jinshi, I got her and tried to keep up, I couldn't I was too overwhelmed with every gameplay mechanic. it was too tricky. nothing could save me. but still, if I kept playing, it would actually be an solid game, but its really hard to keep up if you quit."
"disappointing 1st anniversary rewards i thought kuro is different from hoyo. I was looking forward to the anniversary given how generous they are in PGR. But I guess wuwa is kuro's genshin. Like hoyo, they are more stingy on the game that earns them the most. What a waste."
absolutely sad
got 5 star
"masterpiece of its kind, easy to play, and the dev listened and delivered,"
"Great Story, I love and respect the Main Character. i would have rated it 6 star, if there was an option for that"
best gatcha there is!! combat is incredibly satisfying!
greed ahh company been playing since day one and they started off great but now they are going down the path of greed limiting free rewards behind a summon wall so you can't save for a character you want without spending on top of that they are shifting into a meta where just to maximize DPS on character x I need their exclusive weapon you need character z and their exclusive weapon it's so predatory and I can no longer support a game who doesn't seem to care about their players one bit
"The gameplay experience is enjoyable overall, but the graphics leave much to be desired. The visual elements lack polish and clarity, which detracts from the overall immersion. Additionally, there are numerous adjustments needed to optimize performance and enhance visual fidelity, making it less user-friendly than it could be."
"Underwhelming anniv, rewards are time locked or locked behind pulls and what's with the Changli hidden nerf?"
Definitely love this game! GENSHIN IMPACT HAVE SOME REAL COMPETITION WITH THIS GAME
new anniversary is just pay to win. its just like any other gacha game pay to win! or for returning/ new players.
peak
the game is really fun to play and it's probably going to get harder every time I play it I love playing the game it's kind of fun playing at I hope there's going to be more updates and stuff and like I just like being with the game the game is pretty good the everything the background is good by the battles and everything on their really good too even when I try beating all of it all the games and stuff it ain't that bad but it's kind of hard you know I can't wait to beat more of the game
"Best game, good mechanics, f2p gacha system and generous rewards"
great game
ZANIIII
"Changed from 5 star to 1 star after the anniversary event. Didn't expect free characters or anything, but they are showing their true colors with the predatory whale banners they're calling ""anniversary banners"". Worst wuwa update yet and worst gacha anniversary I've experienced"
"predatory gacha, hope this game eos"
"with anniversary releasing the 1st character that needs another limited to be fully functional, this is a bad indicator of game direction. Hope this isn't the trend now, or else it's gonna suck."
"Zani needs a buff. Without phoebe and her sig weapon, she's useless... I have phoebe, and zani still sucks without her weapon. Even having her with an extra resonance(2 in one ten pull) she does no damage at all! She has no other weapon that could replace her own, and it's annoying. PLS BUFF ZANI OR MAKE BETTER GUANTLETS!!! It's just another boring patch smh.... The anniversary sucked completely..."
interesting.
thank you now I can play I got zani early ‚ù§Ô∏è
best game
I'm using a midrange phone and it lags very much although I don't mind it since I like the game's graphics and story. It's like a Genshin equivalent for midrange phones
"i love wuwa like i really really love the game, im also very THANKFULLLL OF THE BANNERS LIKE WHAT THERES SO MANY 5 STARS TO PICK PLUS WHEN I LOGGED IN I GOT LIKE 10 GOLD ORBS? (i forgot what is called) anyway i gave it a 3 becuz theres alot of 9th gen ipad players that cant play the game properly without crashing and im one of them.. i mean not everyone can afford a pc/laptop so im just hoping that 3.0 update (or maybe early) can allow 9th gen players can play the game without crashingüôè"
"Yay, so super beautiful game. Such as kind of thing that i wish its my second life, and i really appriciated kuro who make this game. He is very kind to all players. Soon, i be came backk. ily"
love the game
it's good I luv the characters üòú
Realy a nice game
OMG THIS GAME IS AWESOME
Your anniversary banner sucks.
extremely awful anniversary üíÄüíÄüíÄ
favorite game ever
Love it!
"lost my account, it was linked to my Google play account and will not recover, 1 star and im not coming back to this game. good luck, play at your own risk, do not respond because I will not be coming back ever!!!!"
Gathering waifus
the best gacha
good combat but the game really needs more alternative 4 star character as good as sanhua.
No free character on anniv?? L dev
This game has features that I like and each event has an interesting theme. I like how the game developer developed this game very well.
"after playing this game since it first came out. they only get better and better in a literal sense. But some things are just so good that their old stuff like the tower of adversity feels like they aged badly. I think this is those few games where I literally enjoyed every aspect of it. From the minigames, the art, the characters, the story, the events, everything. the game runs smooth on my phone now when it couldn't run at all before (at 1.0-1.1). Note: content has tripled since then."
Good game play. Nice story teller. Graphic is very good for mobile game level but does not support some laptop GPUs. The gacha rate is normally bad and understandable. If they remove 50/50 pity's rate that should be better. Normally you should get a 5 star banner character within 160 pulls(80 guarantee drop 2 times). Don't expect too much for a F2P player. Just play and enjoy your life. Another good thing is this game reminds you that you spend too much time in the game and should rest.
Best game ever way better then genshin impact
"Nothing special in this anniversary event. No special rewards and just a bunch of reward events that can't be claimed yet. Some events force us to spend astrite (gacha character) to get rewards. This game is getting greedy. I hope you get better next time. Or I'll leave. Sorry kuro, i've played from the pre-register, but i think this is the end."
Kuro Always improving their game! Great work üî•
suggestion please make a way to reduce the storage because really wanna play this game more but the updates are too big
might be the best anime game i ever played
PRECIOUS THAN GENSHIN
"really good. but I would not recommend this for mobile players. especially the ones who have the limits GB of storage 125 or 135, it really bothers me off. when I tried to fix the issue and move with ease. but couldn't. wuwa please boost the game with mobile compatibility..."
"as expected from the same devs as pgr, combat is phenomenal and challenging, with satisfying effects, deep character kits, and snappy gameplay. Plus the echo system is a fun, and well thought out way to play as captured enemies out In the wild (there are even shiny varieties!). The only real gripe I have is that every time I play It crashes after a while, wuthering waves is a highly resource intensive game, so be mindful of your phones ability (pls optimize for weaker devices devs!)"
great game on mobile
"Please I beg you devs, I know you guys focus on high-end devices but you need to optimize for mid-range and low-end devices... it's been months with no feedback to ppl who can't play the game. High Pings up to 999ms in Western Regions, y'all need to fix this. you're the same ppl who made PGR so why not do the right thing with this game as well. Unreal Engine or not, it's possible to optimize this game. please for crying out loud! üôè"
Amazing game
"The lore and combat are amazing. The character development, engaging storyline, modern and stylish combat, all are plus points of this game and yep fan service is splendid as well. Though some performance issues are there for Android but it has improved a lot over past months and I hope it will continue to and sopve these issues."
"This game has best story and it's just 1.3, I wonder what will come next üíÄ"
Censor Cartethiya please.
Please don't go the Genshin route
Failed to apply remote configuration
pretty good
20gb memory se game ko kam Karen aapane kaun sa unreal engineers mein dala hai banaya to aapane cartoon hi hai unreal engine wali game to 1gb memory se jyada Nahin Hoti very very bad game üò†ü§∑üò§ü§¨
The game crashes in middle of the game although my phone it's new
love it
Terrible anniversary
I hate this game. I lost every 50/50. After a year and level 80 this was not fair.
We NEED more team slots we currently have 5 which is not enough because there's too many team comps and elements.
I love this game
"Updating my review after having a poor experience with the anniversary. I used to like this game but Kuro disappointed me so much. I'll wait to see Cartethyia's story in 2.4 and if that's not satisfying either, I'm totally deleting this game."
literally boring game
the best game in the action ‚ù§Ô∏è
1st I gave 5 stars then 3 now 4 stars but I feel losing interest as my interest seems forced I want more story if you can't give generous pulls
the stutter and crashes have gotten worse and worse every update even when I play the game at the lowest settings. Other games work absolutely fine on my phone but for some reason wuthering waves doesn't. The game crashes every 10 minutes while I'm doing the story or in combat and i have to keep reinstalling the game.
f this game
"2.3... The anniversary. Oh boy, QoL are pretty good ofc, the events are let's be honest not really fun? The cubes are cute but C'mon... Zani? oh man I need Phoebe... what pissed me off the most? that free 10 pull and banner thing dangling in your face and says ""wait for 23 days"" after Zani's banner including Phoebe's. It could arguably say that there's a lot of rewards but stretched to an unbearable time frame. I'm not one of those players ""WHERE'S MY FREE ZANI!?"" but I'm incredibly disappointed"
i try to pull my two account for zani but the both of them get calcharo WTH
I LOVE IT‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•üëë
"1. The ""Anniversary"" Banners are just disguised normal banners. Still 50/50 with 80 pity. 2. This patch caters to Returnees and Money Spenders instead of Day 1 Regular Players. 3. You cannot get the 8 pulls from event unless you pull from the current banner, which is a massive slap on the face for people who are saving for upcoming characters. Kuro is testing how much they get away from being greedy. So unless you're willing to spend money, don't expect much from this game"
"DEVS LISTEN. Game has a rough start at the beginning, but if you power through you'll see big improvements in the storyline eventually!!"
"This game is an absolute gem‚Äîeverything feels spot-on, and I‚Äôm confident it‚Äôs only going to evolve for the better. I‚Äôm not here to nitpick or suggest changes because, honestly, it already nails the experience. However, there‚Äôs one issue that really needs fixing: the official Discord server. Despite never having joined before, I keep getting an invalid invite link whenever I try. No matter what I do, I just can‚Äôt get in. Being locked out of the community is seriously frustrating‚Äîplease FIX this!"
"Anniversary patch has some nice events. It also brought quite a few predatory elements to the game like referrals, rewards locked behind pulling and seemingly mandatory character combos. The base of the game is great, please get back on course"
good
please just add it to xbox so I can play it funnier
"best game ever good story,good gameplay and good characterüóø‚ù§Ô∏è"
I love the characters designs ü§©ü§©
i spent over 100 pulls on jiyan and I still don't have him.
better than genshin
2 Jiyan pulls back to back. woo
noice
ITS SUCH AN EASY MECHANICS I LOVE IT
"Great, great game"
"Good game that has great graphics and gameplay. The 1st Anniversary is just bad. Some rewards are time gated but they still show up on the event page (if I cannot claim it now why show the rewards to me). There are 10 rerun banners to let you pick a previous character without any enhancements to the drop rate, so you better hope you with the 50\50."
Optimisation has improved a little bit . The gameplay is fine but I would suggest a bit more creativity with the events. Edit: 2.0 exceeded well beyond my expectations Edit2: 2.2 story was pretty good Edit : The version 2.3 feels very lackluster overall and a lot of issues are not being addressed properly in the game.
"This game is another example of perfection like the best graphics, great world building, customized characters etc."
Good game keep going kuro
"Increasingly predatory monetization scheme, subpar anniversary rewards. Gameplay is fun, characters have diverse kits, good graphics. But in the 1 year I've played Kuro has become more stingy with free giveaways. New characters being released have kits built around being paired with other paid characters to incentivize even larger buy-in. Prices are predatory. It costs $80-160 to pull a single character. $80 to pull associated weapon. I can't condone the game or industry with these practices."
"Outstanding! Great and different combat mechanics, awesome movement system, great rewards, intreaguing storyline. There's no way I'm returning to Genshin after experiencing this game! Just keep working on phone optimisations! Please! Epic!"
Way better than genshit
bring back the link of my google account to my IGN and user ID.. I don't know what happened but please I'll rate this game 1 star for now if you don't give me my account back.. emailed your support team 3x and no reply for even just an assurance to look into my concern.. come on devs!!!!
"I've been playing since 1.0, and up to 2.2, I truly loved it. waiting for the anniversary had me hyped‚Äîit felt like Kuro actually cared about us. but 2.3... it just hurts. I don‚Äôt feel as excited as I used to."
"THE WORST FANDOM EVER The fandom is making the game feel like it's only for males and all they can talk about is the female character's body parts rather than the events, lore and what not. They're ruining the image of the game by being only able to talk about said female body parts, it's utterly disgusting and worst of all, those men are probably porn addicts, just ew. I just hope people can enjoy the game aside sexualizing the characters"
G.O.A.T
please don't use this game Because it's Take my 75GB storage and lift 53 GB i beg you and realme c55 ram 8gB storage 128gb processor mediatek helio g88
"bad anniversary gift especially the anniversary banner, too much event going on and barely fun games for me, but thank you for everything you give to us since day 1."
"Stuck at 100% when updating the game on Play Store. I already downloaded the pre-download before the update rolled in, and when i tried running the game, it told me to update it on play store, which is now stuck at 100% . ive tried restarting the download, restarting my phone, clearing the data and cache of the playstore app, nothing worked. i really dont wanna reinstall the game as it will take a long time with my slow wifi. how do i fix this"
"it's amazing and more player friendly than the ""other"" game. I've stopped playing in 1.2 because of the terrible optimization and extremely low fps but those problems doesn't seem to exist now. On the other hand, I really hope a feature wherein we can showcase our characters, including their builds, weapons, echoes etc. as well as allow us to peek into other players' character builds is added. I think it increases more in-game interaction among players which should be good for the game. ‚ò∫Ô∏è"
trash rewards
Best game. Period.
its a good game the graphics and visual is amazing and the gacha system is good the way that its characters move and the physics are good with the parkours gliders and etc.
I can't even enter the game after update! please fix this Kuro....
VERY bad optimisation compared to other games sometimes it's unplayable.
edit: kuro seems to be losing the plot each day a little more
goood
makasih bg
"This...is most disheartening. For the anniversary of all events, Kuro has decided to run their villain arc. Predatory upon predatory incentives, straying away from the kuro we all hoped them to be and severed our expectations and spit on our face. Come on kuro, do better."
Becoming hella greedy Kuro...
Wow üò≥
"This game is so good, rough start but it keeps getting better. Update: change my mind my friends now are quitting because of disappointment, thought they're not going to be greedy but now they are!"
upon world game nice
Amazing. I play HSR and ZZZ but WuWa is simply the best RPG game you can download to your phone or tablet and Genshin isn't even in the same league and yes I do like that game but I do not play it anymore
"Good game. Crash, frame drop, bad optimization."
I love this game and thanks kuro for ur beautiful work but man kuro do you hate me! I always lose my pity and that also hard pityüò≠üò≠ and today I lost my pity at zani too kuro man please make my gacha pull a Lil bit better.
good
Zani best waifu
"My device is mid yet it's fine at medium settings - a huge win for me. Had played since release, all the improvements are very noticeable; while most could say it should've released this way, I get why they focused on refining the basics... how they possibly could. The combat is still strongest suit of Kuro Games, graphics coming in second. I don't regret my spent time here at all, despite the doomposting - try for yourself and find what appeals to you. Don't listen to others."
worst game ever played
underwhelming aniversary update. greedy devs. Zani is useless without Phoebe. Too many banners running simultaneously but not so much free pulls.
worst event they nerfed phoebe for zani and in the tower challenge final u can't defeat without zani or jinshi very bad THEY DID IT ON PURPOSE and I hate it
Beautiful.
Please update ryzen 5 7500f for requirement 120 fps
great game but my device is not that good so mostly I lag in the good cutscenes and something I lag while in battle and all my settings are currently on the lowest but I still give it a 10/10 great game love the characters the attack effects are crazy good in my opinion this game is better than genshin impact sorry for all the genshin lovers but this is my opinion
is this game have a bug or what. I could have sworn that last time I got standard character 5 star in the rate up banner. now I tried to pull for zani and why do I get another standard character. are you really kidding. this is different from what your banner said.
bad anniversary rewards
"BEWARE: Zani sucks. Forced co-op event in single-player game. Bad development team puts in a new character that needs items that cannot even be collected yet! And stop using the Rover as the Main Character, the Rover sucks."
"Performance got marginally better, so my review got marginally better as well. Keep up the good mobile optimization work and we'll be at 5 stars in no time. It's LITERALLY the only problem the game has."
Anniversary patch is currently a disappointment.
"been playing this for few weeks now, i love the graphics and how optimized the game is now than before, but it is so hard to get something on pulls, i always get purple even at 60 pulls, i got bored suddenly, feels like i am grinding for nothing, i don't have anymore goals since i don't even have any 5 star resonator nor even a weapon beside the free one."
this game of story is really Very Good and Fun to play. I request to developer to do more optimization AND I won my 1st 50 50 after 3 losses.
rewards for anniversary are bad
very amazing game love it
Best graphics in a mobile game ever!
Really Good game and good devüòé
love you
"Very scummy handling of the 1st anniversary, pyramid scheme invite event that doesn't include old players as anything more than superspreaders, an event that's just ""wait until just after the current banner ends for 10 rolls"", and anniversary rerun banner with 10 selectable characters over two phases and unchanged pity/odds/coinflip."
all wuthering and no waves. what else u gonna play tho
best game New concept in open world game I love to play this game
"for some reason after I updated the game, it keeps kicking me out even when my phone is not overheated and my graphics are smooth."
"the overall game experience is super game and is very generous with the rewards, however I was told that old player will be getting free 5 star characters and I still did not receive any ?"
"best game ever, now it has his 1st anniversary ü•≥ congratulations Kuro games"
ü•Ä
"goated game, love the devs, yes its a classic gacha game but imo the best one right along side pgr"
It's awesome
Best Game 4Ever
kinda bad
It is not a kuro company.Game is improved but dev is very greedy but other games like pgr and aether gazer are generous but in wuwa they become greedy üò° after genshin wuwa dev is worst dev.
good
The art and how the characters show emotions is what made me play this game more and the story is really interesting
Best cuma klau mid range fon Dia kdg lag
i love this game
suuuuuuuuuuuper
Not interested anymore.....
like it
"The best gacha game there is, exceptional quality in all aspects of the game, with devs that closely listened to the players too. Keep striving to improve Kuro! Amazing game!"
Kuro best developer unlike hoyoverse
Best game ive ever played
i feel like this game has no 50/50 chance i literally haven't won a single 50/50 everytime is s lose if i were to rate the worst 50/50 on gacha games this is the game
Top tier since say 1 (idk if my phone explodes)
love the event and game!
I just disconnected randomly tho these happend only from boss fights but not when I am just exploring ye that's my only issue
"I played this game for months, was so thrilled about everything in this game but it all vanished when my character got stuck in a dungeon... i can't get out from there i can't do anything...help me please, I'll download again today just to see if it's playable or not."
Looks promising happy 1st birthday WuWa
I've been enjoying
gracias kuro por mi doble 5*
"The experience and the story are great, including the fights mechanics and the exploration system, it really give you a great experience and you want to know more about the characters and that's what I want. And add some males chars pleaseü§£ü§£, I'm bored of seeing 99 girls in any anime games, even if the most percent of players are men, we do like the good male characters too. Great anniversary BTW."
this game is very amazing.hope they keep the quality until this game become number 1 gacha game. i will always support you kuro games.
best rpg game
the game keeps closing i have a good device i dont know why fix it pls
good gameplay
Greedy company
"Vaya decepci√≥n de aniversario, eliminen esa palabra y queda igual que cualquier versi√≥n de relleno"
"Game, graphics, Characters, Gameplay, Developers are just awesome ‚ù§Ô∏èü§åüî•."
Doesn't appreciate the players that stay after a horrible launch
best game ever‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èü•∞
pretty good on Android. way better on PS5.
fix problem lagging mobile the game is over
The censors have been undone. Praise Solon.
idk the reason why but when you set your graphic to lower its feel more laggy than higher graphic setting please do something about ts
nice game I like the combat fuction and also the graphics and animation of the characters haha the only prob is my phone if only my phone ü§£can handle it I'm so enjoy now but I'll rate this 5or10 I'll buy a new phone next time I hope you'll improve this game more thanksüòÖ
hell yeah
I love this game
"Takes 45+GB on my tablet, please kuro do somethinggüò≠"
takes small capacity on my storage yet so laggy
"kuro,before u add more characters pls just fix ur game issues its so laggy even the graphic not that high on android vers"
best open world game ever
"great game but ,, it's optimization is awful, I'm a gacha player I also play genshin, zzz other game they are quite smooth. other hand wuthering waves it's a great game but optimization and graphics ar not phone friendly ,,, developers should work on it"
"Amazing quality story, music, visuals and exploration. -1 star cause it is a gacha game"
"Wuwa 2.0 issue -crashing. I can't play after Rinascita ,UL-80, so sad üò≠üò≠üò¢"
"always get calcharo and hard pity, so I stop my monthly"
"As a genshin player, I just started and already love it! The graphics are amazing, I love the skip button, and the characters designs are just top notch."
"RIGHT NOW I AM AT ZERO PITY I DID ONE TEN PULL AND I GOT CALCHARO , ZANI TWICE (IN A SINGLE 10 PULL). THE REVIEW BAR POPPED. I AM VERY LUCKY. AND I AM VERY HAPPYüòÅüòÅ."
"Fun mechanics for combat and exploration, specially after 2.0 update. It may not be my favourite art style but it damn looks and runs good. A modern take in open world mobile gatcha games and hopefully future blueprint to how respectful are with their players."
"this game is peaked, keep going!"
carlotta and zani are so wifey
"Great storyline, great gameplay,great charcters, great map, it is an amazing game ü©µ‚ù§Ô∏èü©∑"
Could you give me pls Phoebe she's the reason why I came back playing this game again...this is my only whis thanks
decent game and awesome battle system. love the story and environment. love the qoL given in 2.0 can't wait for more updates kuro
it's laggy on mobile devices and tabs even with great processors like snapdragon gen 2 other than that the game is good
just perfect
it has a very good fighting system and good graphics too It's worth playing
"Game First, Gacha Second is the right word to describe this game. The improvement from 1.0 was amazing, especially 2.2 Main Quest was fenomenal, the story telling, the music, the graphics, and the combat are amazingly done, good job Kuro Games."
Personally it works perfect for me with almost all the graphics on max with minor lags sometimes even though my mobile isn't really a gaming one
rated 1 ‚≠ê to 5 ‚≠ê
Good anniversary boys. Hope to never see this again
the enshittification started quite early with this one
This game absolutely amazing üî•üî•üî•
"please optimize this for mobile, genshin impact runs really good on max graphics, while This game runs on 24 fps while in lowest graphics+phone over heats"
Amazing game
love the gameplay and graphics
thanks you for everything
"5 stars, the newest 2.3 update makes the gameplay smoother, and the map is expanding (23GB max). Still smooth combat and controls with engaging storytelling. Extremely impressed! (April 2025 update)"
"I loved it , everything about the game is just awesome I just have one suggestion, the developers could optimise the game a little more so that it runs on low end phones smoothly too"
Best game....if only I could get more astrites fastüò≠...
"My standards for the anniversary were low yet you still somehow disappoint me. It's not even about the pitiful rewards, it's about the gameplay, the events. It's all login events covered in shiny paint one even forces you to use limited pulls to get the rewards, and one combat event, qol, the usual. I wasn't even expecting a free 5 star, only a one time guarantee on the ""anniversary banner"" which is just a rerun banner."
KATA BIM. KURO SANGAT BAIK
"Game's peak although I do hope the optimization more on mobile devices when it comes to these challenges & areas, hoping chances of acquiring characters as well as weapon guarantees are limited to 5 tries only, I mean 80 is a bit of a stretch I would've settled on 50 and it would've been helpful for most of my companions. 1 last thing devs Really love on what you did for Zani y'all really avoided snowbreak's mishap. Keep up the good work, also more compressions for storage please?"
"Bagust, yuk maenlah"
VERY NICE GAME
"Amazing game, truly a pleasure to play."
finally got optimized üôèüò≠
"There's parry, dodge, counter, tools and echo that helps in exploration, 4 star characters or even rover can even solo Challenges... Kuro are toooo kind... Thank you to the developers, designers, VA and others... and lastly thank you kuro...."
"The art style is too dark for me but I love the character designs and combat.And mobile optimization is clearly bad, even terrible. I hope it will be resolved as soon as possible."
GOOD „Åô„Åî„ÅÑ
I make it 4 star because I don't know
the visual is the only thing that keeps me playing
Bestttttt game ever
Kuro is turning on the players and becoming more like Genshin Impact. Extremely predatory with their latest update.
amazing gameplay
"Medium Whale . Only one word to say : "" Hail Kuro"" 1) Best customer service as they listen to every feedback by players. 2) Absolutely broke my expectations by introducing 1st Mt. Firmament then 2nd Black Shores and LAST absolute masterpiece Rinascita. 3) Music has broken through and reached Mt. Everest. 4)With simple Story writing which is easy to understand but with a Movie like presentation has bought other mobile games to shame. 5) Combat was always good nothing to comment in it. 6)FLIGHT"
"1 year of playing but the anniversary is so disappointing, its like remembering genshin impact, waste of time and money now to play"
nice
"Have to uninstall the game even after asking for almost 9 month in every survey to add the 120fps option for everyone without any restriction of hardware still hasn't been solved, in the 2.3 livestream notes they was a line 120 fps is now be available on wide range of gpu and after today the update come out it's only for too high end user like 50 seires not for my 3050ti pair with i7 12gen like I ca run more heavy game than wuwa easily but still if you not gonna listen then bye"
the game was good for a few months until it literally became borderline unplayable the game keeps on crashing
"I like this game, very beautiful and unique. Recommend it truly"
This game has been my best game this year I was playing this game since it launch I know that the game will improve more as it will go this passing years and I cant forget the feedback response to this game good job devs for making a great game
"The game is really good in terms of graphics and combat, and the story is also not uninteresting."
Good game...but hopefully kuro will release it in console...it will be pretty amazing thoüôà...
My device cant run this game even with 8gb ram and decent processor. i had to uninstall. dont have any other choice
love it
"yep, the anniversary is mid af"
Amazing game
nice game
Best gacha game out there
bad anniversary
Very exciting game with combat. There is an issue with void thunder mistranslation
i just hate the censored edit: they fix itüòã
"this is the BEST game I have played I played it since it came out and its very good I love the plot the combat, boss fights and everything wuwa never fails to make a good quest story"
best game ever!!
thank u dok give me 5star and I give u 5star
"I've been a loyal player since release, and I really enjoy wuwa in general. I'm already at the end-game field, and I don't really face much issues aside from lag time to time but after the anniv update, I literally can't play. The game works well outside of engaging in combat as usual, but whenever I try to defeat enemies, it just freezes, then unfreezes then the same thing? my ping stays at 70ms which isn't that high, I really hope it's only a bug for now and hope it gets fixed !"
Love very much
NAHHHH
the game is very good. I was going to give it 5 stars but the problem is that whenever I open the game it starts compiling shaders. it started happening after this update. so i kindly request to developers to fix this issue. it takes 5 to 10 mins to compile.
too heavy on phone üòÖ
"Best Gacha Game I played honestly, it just keeps on getting better and better. I'm glad I played since day 1, I will continue to support this game because it deserves it."
actually I would have given this a 5 star rating for the game experience. I really found this very interesting and fun to play but the major problem I am currently going through is storage. I am a mobile player and as a mobile user i dont have that many storage. so I hope you would do something for this very soon.
good game
bagi la aku menangüòå
"playing wuwa on mobile is nice but it overheats my phone, but not that much anymore. The lag is okay im not complaining even tho it pause my game but I don't mind it. KEEP IT UP WUWA DEVS :DD IGNORE ALL THE HATES FROM OTHER PPL, alot of us are not that greedy for the pulls/wishes. I have been playing this since last year and I rlly like how much everything improve, thank you for listening to all of us:)) THANK YOUU FOR THE HARD WORK YOU ALL DONE!!"
The best game I ever play
the greatest game of all time
there is an issue in the iqoo z9x where it crashes automatically or gets terrible fps pls try to fix it
Keep up the good work Kuro! Good gaming experience with devs listening to opinions. Congratulations on your 1st anniversary
"A gacha game where the devs actually listens to what players want and is very generous when it comes to rewarding their players. Fun gameplay and very beautiful scenery in the game, but the devs should tone down with the fan service. Hope they don't serve the fans too much service and add more male playable characters"
Excellent work of art
game ramah buat pemula gamplay simple enak smooth
My favorite game but it needs to work on lower end devices as well. still solid for everyone though.
"I like this game, not forcing you to listen to the story (having a skip button) and then even REWARDING you with beautiful cutscenes <3 after anniversary: lost some of my respect. 12 banners and not a single guarantee? how is this an ANNIVERSARY? especially the first one. disappointed."
good
super game ü•∞
This game is one of the best games I've played of it's genre. Literally has EVERYTHING you want and need without realising. Combat is perfect Aesthetics also Adventure and so on can keep rambling but basically it's 10/10 The best part is that the Devs are CONSTANTLY LISTENING TO US! now the juicy bad bits.... Slyly laggy at times on mobile. edit: gave it 3stars instead of 5stars because the ratio of female to male characters is just too much and I think they're tryna sexualise women for profit
zanii sama saiikooo
Greatüëç
"I really like the game and the graphics and my phone seems to cope quite well, but for some reason it overheats so much that it just quits the game for me"
im a kurobot they deserve it
The game is really laggy in both PC and mobile.
best game but some work to do in graphics
"bad game too much fanservice only releases female character and so lag gameplay, gooner game."
the best game ever
Such broad experience I gained from it.It give me adrenaline everytime I play it
I love this game
thank you for the luck!!!!!!!!!!!
too glitchy
"This game is beautiful and enjoyable to play, but I‚Äôve been experiencing a really frustrating issue ‚Äî whenever my character sprints, sometimes they suddenly freeze or become unresponsive, even though there‚Äôs no lag at all. Occasionally they move again, other times I have to jump to get control back. This isn‚Äôt a device or touchscreen issue, as other apps work fine. I hope the devs can fix this bug soon because it seriously affects the gameplay experience, especially during combat and exploration"
The worst anniversary
better than hoyo slop
"Unbelievable graphics and detail, design storyline all üëå"
best game ever
üóøüóøüóøüî•üî•üî•
Great game. My account is very lucky i win like 3 times hahah. I love you kuro
wuwa is the best
Number 1
"to the respected developer I apologize for lowering the review by 1 star because there is a problem with the signal network which I personally think is very disturbing to the comfort of playing. for some reason in other games there are no significant signal problems, while before the update and after this update the network is still problematic and causes high ping and lag. the rest for the extraordinary anniversary give thank you developer thx and always be victorious."
"I GOT XIANGLI YAO IN 30 PULLS, AND JIYAN 10 PULLS RIGHT AFTER???? NO WAY. anyways give us more men"
"Instead of saying the limited convene is 50/50 U should say it as 80/20. cause 80% time u will lose. it sucks man.OHERWISE Tho THE GAME IS GOOD,FUN AND ENJOYABLE"
"i love your anniversary, its cute, fun and easy. i love it soooo much, great experience, very f2p for me. i love your game Kurooo!"
the best of the bestüëåüòé
love the game a lot. not like pther gacha game
absolute cinema
bro 40gb is insane
I am dropping it to 4 star because there is lack of rewards in anniversary patch. don't get me wrong compared to other gatchas wuwa gave a lot of rewards but compared to kuro itself it's underwhelming.
Amazing graphics and gameplay and I want to thank to the devs forgiving us free stuff
The best game until Armageddon
Getting linyang after rerolling 3x is crazy
absolute peak!
convene for resonator 70 times and after that I get another resonator this game is scam
1st yes
"(edit){everything is fine little bit lag and frame drop are frequent after version update 2.0 maybe vast expanse map last I don't like censorship bring back orginal one which I paid for)As i would love to see more fanservice elements in the game. Enhancing character designs and adding more interactive features would definitely keep the community excited and invested. Keep up the great work, Kuro Games, and please consider adding more fanservice to make this game even better!"
"i love the game, but it need more improvement at compatibility at mobile, sometime i lag even in good connection, i hope there will be more improvement for mobile, if there already optimize, i do 5 stars rating"
"playing on an android tablet and game is set at balanced performance mode, I don't need that much HD graphics, youtube got that already from PC gamers. playable characters and NPCs show emotions on their faces. cut scenes are beautiful. gameplay is nice. I need Calcharrot's full story..."
I LOVE WUTHERING WAVES!!!! THIS IS A GENUINE REVIEW! üòÜü•∞
the game has a lot of problems such as no new male or 4 star characters
peak
"dev tolong tambahkan setting untuk bermain dengan menggunakan gamepad, untuk segi grafis dan story game sudah bagus hanya tolong tambahkan bahasa Indonesia sajaüôè"
"it always lags, leaves the game when it overheats on my phone, and i can't even update the game to play it. it doesn't let me play anymore."
great game
greed got U kuro
I love it It's great for anime watchers BTW HAPPY ANNIVERSARY WUWA
Ok maybe this is a glitch or a misunderstanding but why do I have to download the resources but I already downloaded it last night now I have to download it again üòî
50/50 kote
Amazing best game everüíÖ‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®‚ú®
"I love playing this game and so far my experience with it is good but sometimes it crashes out of nowhere even tho my phone can handle the game really well without any lag, I wish they address this issue ASAP also it would really help if they add mouse and keyboard support for non PC players."
The anniversary gifts don't define you. You made a good game and I'm rating Wuwa 5 star coz of the game not the rewards
Happy anniversary
"Trash game, during launch it was f2p friendly. Now u get nothing, inspite u are a p2p. network bug. lag. bug full of trash. Don't spend data in this trash game. I want to give 0 star, but there is no option."
"Play it from release date until now and my comment for this game is ""it's Peak"". developer listen, improvements, Generous reward ( I don't complain for anniversary reward tho. charlotta & Changli skin is all I wish and they release it), etc. I played several gacha gaming, and this game is one you can call Player Friendly (Your Luck & skill is the issue). keep up the good work Kuro game üî•"
"better than genshin, sorry hah"
Best mobile game ever.
i love this game :>
"I like the game,but when your on a low end phone because your poor, it can be laggy and sometime it just freeze, so for my opinion that in the future it can be playable in a low end phone"
i can't update it. it's just stop at 100% and does not uodate
The game is nice and beautiful but when I downloaded the game again. My past acc got deleted. It has changli in it and I downloaded the game when it first released.
"The game's peak,but can you do rus localisation plsüôèüèªü•π"
this game is really good but pacing is little bit slow
"Everything is absolutely awesome, but takes a lot of time for verifying files, loading, and change accounts. And absolutely keep lagging and framing. Even though my pc already pass on minimum high requirement"
best gacha game I've ever played so far! keep up the great work kuro!
"its very nice and epic game, I've been playing since the release, its awesome and i recommend playing this game"
"Please make rover element change possible without doing main quest. Lag in old regions better but new ones are more laggy in open world for mediatek processors. new edit: Anniversary banner? instead of gifting a low pity or guarantee banner or free weapon youre asking ppl to ""spend"" more for our support being done for an year. Very disappointed."
great game
"anniversary events is boring, also the cube didn't even have voice. full of bug as always."
"been playing ever since it came out, and it's so nice to say that there have been a lot of changes since then, despite the rewards in the 1st anniversary im grateful that i can still easily grind for more astrites im excited for the future of this game hoping kuro will keeping listening to us lets not take it for granted"
"ngl the grafics are out of this world, the chapter four story line god you did good game devs I cried at the end of story four best game ever, better than genshin impact. keep it up"
LADY ZANI!!! PLEASE STEP ON ME
"The game is truly amazing but I don't think low end devices should suffer even in lowest settings. Meanwhile Genshin is still smooth and playable for me but This? Not a chance...So please optimize this game please... It's the only game I can actually enjoyed playing before. It has really slow response when I'm fighting Echoe, then, My phone will randomly shut down and It restarted my whole phone. Please for the sake of low end devices players"
best game ever
"I'm giving 5 stars cause the game is actually amazing and super fun throughout the last year of my time playing. But I do think there's room for optimization, like previously I used to play Genshin and it was petty but smooth. I know there are more combat options, more utility and everything than other games. But the dev team, you should pay more attention to existing games optimization than adding new maps/features."
"This game is one of the most fun games I've played. Combat and traversal are immensely fun, and Rinascita is such a big improvement from the beginning of the game. Edit: I'd really love if characters interacted with each other and not just Rover."
great
always lose 50/50 since day one to first anniversary nice game 100% lose 50/50 bye
"Love this game so much. Good games. Good Devs. I have been playing this game for a year now. Never want to rate it before. But, after Zani, it is a five stars!"
awesome
If ur into open world games and fun combat why have you not tried this game yet
ok
"Happy Anniversary to Wuthering Waves! Today marks a special milestone for this incredible free-to-play open-world action RPG developed by Kuro Games. It‚Äôs been an amazing year since the game‚Äôs launch, and the anniversary celebration, kicking off with the version 2.3 update on April 29, 2025, brings exciting new content like the characters Zani and Ciaccona, along with fun events such as ""Cube, Cubic n Cubie"" and generous rewards for players.This celebration highlights..."
"it's really a story rich game , having fun in story and challanges both üòºü§åüèª"
Need some fixing for mobile version. Please...
nice RPG and fiery combat
game is good. but always expect to lose from 50-50 resonator banner. as a day 1 player it's disheartening to lose consecutively in the resonator banner.
"i have changed my mind after 2.3, this is the best game ever genuinely saying, they optimised the games and reward so generous, thank you kuro games for the birthday gift ‚ù§Ô∏è."
not interest
W anniv update
"very, very, very unfriendly to casual players"
"Thanks add ps version. But i have some problem, can your reply my email for give me some any suggest? Thanks. I will change my rate after my problem with mobile & ps account solve. Thanks"
add more men
"Overall, WuWa is a good game with a solid plot and interesting characters. Kudos to KuroGames for their hard work and dedication to improving the game!! ^^"
Amazing game!!! Really blew my mind!! Some much needed competition to genshin and it's predatory practices. These guys are doing some good work and I really really appreciate that. The main character is also awesome and the story is about the main character and not someone else. GOATED GAME FR
"After last update game is unplayable. High ping spikes, game crashes every 5 minutes and camera is broken"
"pasado de pilin, es muy Buen juego"
best gacha game not like G
best gatcha game ever!
"After everything thta happened at launch the fixes they made to the game is really good, but i hope they add that feature where you can delete past quest resources bc the 2.4 update is literally taking 40 gb on my phone and i sadly only have 63 gb rn i hope they listen to this huhuüòîüòîüôèüôèüôè"
"""My luck is bad."" ""I have bad luck."""
"The game is nice and all, I'm familiar with this kind of games. But the only flaw is that I can't fricking see when I have to dodge an attack. The camera adjustment is just not it. I've tried going through settings but nothing. The enemy moves so fast and it's so small, really hard to see with all those effects and things. I'm talking about the end-game stuff ofc"
this is the best game I've ever played in my life and the graphics is out of this world and the character designs is good and this game is my comfort zone after coming from school and I am not a p2w player and I got shorekeeper on a 10 pull and it changed my gameplay and ty wuwa developers for everything that u done and congratulations on your 1st anniversary and ty guys!!
i like the game but it needs more optimization
idc about other's opinion. Kuro Games >
"Stunning visuals, amazing gameplay."
lack of optimization
great game with a bad bad bad toxic community
"I played wuwa before rinascita released. It was an enjoyable experience, I enjoyed traveling the map and acquiring an Easter egg achievement. I hope wuwa has an event that refreshes weekly with asterite rewards so that players can farm there and be able to pull for their desired characters. I'm an F2p player btw. I also have problems with finding chests using the lootmapper. I just wish that there could be a device that can be used with a lootmapper to see if it's underground or on the surface."

Excellent devs..game came too far from launch and I am sure will be the best open world gatch within next few patches..keep it up!!!
Nice game
The only gacha game where I haven't even skipped a single dialogue.
"I love the game so much, I want this game to flourish even more :3"
Nice rates
Peak
love this game so much!!
gacor
best game.
I loved the game the storyline of the game is amazing. I hope you update soon
fix your phone port because I'm crashing in the loading screen
"I've been playing wuwa since the beginning because i quit genshin as they become such a greedy game with no good content. Wuwa has it's up and down but i remain loyal since the game really generous and keep hearing what the community wants. I thought my loyalty has been paid off because 2.2 update made me believe that the future of the game is going to be great. Then 2.3 comes out, it shocked me that the game i believe is so generous has worse anniversary gift than Genshin. No words left to say."
pls add the delete past resources option feature
please give Indonesian sub
"HAPPY ANNIVERSARY KURO GAMES AND WUTHERING WAVES!!!! MANY HAPPY YEARS TO COME FOR US!!! (In case anyone wants an honest review:) great character designs. the in game model is as beautiful as the 2d art. Unique gameplay, there's dodge, counterattack, and different fighting styles depending on the character's forte. The world is beautiful and map exploration is easy to do. The voice actor can be improved, but I'm satisfied with everything else! thank you, kuro games!"
i really love this game
bro we have uninstall the game for this new update we should now waste 17 GB data and wait for the damn shaders
it can still be a bit laggy at times which really sucks since I love the game mechanic and it's literally the only game I'm playing right now skskks
now they said I can play it without downloading any more resources after that 15GB's downloadüíîüíîüíî great game tho!
"I love the game, it literally looks like a triple A game, the visuals are amazing, the gameplay of the newer characters are astounding and of course, the character designs are through the roof. Definitely 5 out of 5 stars, no questions asked. Can't change my mind."
its good but if you play longer on mobile its hot. optimization is need
best exploration game
This is wonderful Game
peak gacha experience
it is a very good game and it takes care of tha players how ar f2p
i love this game it has all the aspect of what a great game isi love it thank youu for making such a great game
Mommy Zani. Must I say more?
Impressive
The dev response is fast and they keep on updating.
best
"Very laggy indeed only for iphone users not for android like realme,oppo"
best game ever
i love this game i am max level been playing over a year and im glad i stuck with it from the beginning he amount of improvement this game has done is insane i would definitely recommend if you like anime games
"After one year with this game I'm gonna have to call it quits, The events are great, the new regions are amazing but everything is too condensed, there's also no sense of character progression when it comes to the story. lastly the abysmal echo farming pushed me over the edge... I'll come back in 6-8 months Lord willing and hopefully we will have an item to fix substats. Otherwise great game... just not as it is right now."
"To all the haters, your GI is no way near. just admit it."
amazing game frfr
Mantap
Nice üëç
"Will still play for the characters and gameplay. But the genshittification is really sad to see now that they have reached a wider audience üòû. Still a gacha game after all. ""W, this is so payer friendly!"""
"Be better, I saved 65 pulls and still don't have enough to garentee the first banner in ANNIVERSARY patch garbage everything was thrown away in the garbage rewards of the anniversary"
noicegot double zani
"one of the Best gacha/open world game i've played, i'm hoping for the community to grow even more larger"
"My Favourite game , i will play life time"
best games!
game burik bagusan sekiro
Why do the graphics and gameplay have to be so amazing and then the drop rates be total garbage? Why do you do this in every single game Kuro?
Absolute Cinema.
the new update made the game unplayable :( it crashes so easily now on my s24 fe
"Peak Combat, Graphic, now ray tracing avail in AMD GPU! they know what we want, your wish their priority."
nice screen play and awesome storyline this is the game I want .this is better version of genshin impact good character design and a lot things in there you guys should try this definitely worth of playing
Amazing animation and the best story line in all of gacha games
love the game
I LOVE playing wuwa and I've been a player since the day it got released but i might have to leave this game because I'm running out of space. This game is exceeding 40GB. So i hope wuwa does something about it like deleting past resources so i can have space for new updates.
"better game mechanics, lore, characters and overall just better then H**** games :) Kuro is at the peak looking down to capitalism games targeting young gamers. salute Kuro and more good energy comes your way."
luv it
I love it
Love this game. It's just a bit laggy sometimes. It's really good but there's always a lack of echo upgrade materials.. not to mention the fact that Echoes rely on rolling to get a substat.. if that fails then you end up using more mats.. which we always lack.. please add a mode where we can get a lot of these and not just rely on events that give these out..
"This game is amazing, counter parry a enemy in the game at the right moment feels satisfying but will take time to master. and dodging is really cool. Exploring the the open is truly amazing. Even though playing this on mobile can be hard sometimes because am using a Sg S10+ which is understandable, it functions well, but not so well when playing in co-op because of my phones loading time :( but am glad that WUWA is now on Ps5 which I'll be upgrading pretty soon. Thank you Kuro"

"Best mobile game on the market. Open world, generous and beautifully stunning visuals."
"One of the best gacha games for me, has good combat. The asthetic or setting is dark, which suits my tastes. Also, great character designs. Even tho low no.of males and 4 stars hope they add more males. Please if u add make it a 1:1 ratio I mean like For 1 male we have 1 female playable character."
they're becoming more predatory with the player
Better than Genshin üó£Ô∏èüó£Ô∏èüó£Ô∏è
A Gacha game that respects the fan base. I am in
every time downloading the entire game
let's goo
"Its been almost a month. The game is still laggy and always crashing. Im losing hope now that it will be fixed. Need to accept Wuwa is not for my phone. Edit: it is still crashing, my phone heats up pretty quick everytime I play then its will crash. But the smoothness was back."
This is the most beauteous game I have ever came across MY LOVE FOR ZANI WILL PULL HER TOWARDS ME
most beautiful animation game and best experience all adventures üòçüëçüèª
"For Zani, I can forgo sleep today. For ZAAAANNNIIIII!!!!!!!! ORRRAAAAAGGGHHHHH!!!!"
the roster is heading in a bad direction. Units are too reliant on specific partners due to the new debuffs.
"Really Good game Comparing to other open worlds in 1.0 Edit: Still on top, really satisfying"
the character designs are impeccable
its awesome
"love the game, the visuals, the gameplay, the story, however the only complaint I have is how hard it is to farm astrites, on top of that the pulls are abysmal I immediately lose my 50/50 on both weapons and resonator, please add some pity points or at least give us a meter on how many pulls we have left for the featured resonator, if this issue can be fix I will gladly give the game five stars"
its good
Good game
badly optimized
"Been playing this game since day 1. It's still one of my favourite games. Gameplay, Graphics, Updates, Characters.. everything is amazing. never had a single bug or a complaint."
still the best gacha game for me in terms of graphics!
I love kuro games
changed from 5 to 3 stars simply because the game barely releases male characters.
"Just got a double 5 star, so yeah 10/10 game will be playing until I die"
I just straight up love this game the combat is different than other open-world gacha games unique characters every update and kuro is very generous I don't see any reason to not play this masterpiece
"Awful 1st anniversary ""rewards""."
"wuwa is great. There is so much potential it's just that wuwa on android phones have heating issues. i hate buying expensive iPhones. wuwa is perfect compared to genshin impact, which i am disappointed."
I love this game
they partially removed censorship...
"Great game, mobile optimization can still be better"

maa kasaam bohot acha game hai üòò
"Solid, a bit of a bumpy ride at launch but devs are really trying and it shows. So far so good. Update: 2.0 is a blast, everywhere I look is beautiful and flying is fun. Update 2: First anniversary, first real disappointment. Same as any other companies, greed is here to stay I guess... I'll be updating my review if anything changes."
Absolutely trash anniversary. Not player friendly at all . Kuro has shown that in the end they are just another greedy gacha company.
"At first I really thought, are they really serious this game is totally FREE?? yeah HAHAH it's all free, and the devs are listening"
Awesomeness
"the best story talling(an like the other game that black and white screen teller), best action open world game, the best gacha system thank kuro! and happy anniversary!"
"This anniversary is so mediocre. And you can't even get 10 pulls from claiming before Zani banner ends. Gilded Nightmarket tasks are mostly all convene based. Kuro, you lost my trust with this one, seemingly becoming a greedy company."
Yeahhhhh
I love LOVE this game
"NIH GAME NIAT BANSOS MULU BEJIRüò≠‚ù§ Sayang banget sama Kuro dari jaman PGRüòã‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§ Semangat yhh developer, gw bakal tetep main gamenya & support meski device kentangüôèüèªüíÄüî• edit : woi yang bener aja updatenya sampe 40GB+ ü§° tapi gapapa, gw apus apk lain demi ini üòû"
ohh
great
"this game is truly good, its like a 5 star game"
"the game is really good , the developers are really generous for each patch they have introduced things to make the player experience better and better and the amount of Rewards given are also very satisfactory not to mention that the game is also really well optimised for phone now"
best gacha game I've played so far. devs really cared about their players and the community. but unfortunately im a bit disappointed with the anniversary
"Best dev team in all gacha games (I take that back, their true colours are finally showing with the horrendous anniversary rewards)"
one of the best game I've played has a fun combat style and has a very entertaining storyline but one thing for me though is the lag it's probably just my device and please add a past resurce delete cuz it taking so much space in my phone but still a very fun and entertaining game recommend to have at least a big storage space if not then you might have to delete some things.
The best game frü´∂
üò≠üò≠
"Great game honestly, the graphics, the battle,storyline,etc. But its not for a mobile game in my opinion, with the latest updated download size more than 40GB, its way to big. It will be great to be play in PC or Console in a big screen size."
love the game
"I can not get enough of this game man, Now I started off a genshin player and I said that wuwa was a copy of genshin oh was I wrong, wuwa feels more lively then genshin. The movement is amazing and on my I could go on and on but I will keep it short. Genshin really needs to copy somethings in wuwa like Skip and separate weapon banners. overall wuwa better‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
"Honestly, I've been enjoying Wuwa alot, it's also the only open world game that I actually play too. I love the character designs and the storyline, and I really enjoy the gameplay. It's one of my favorite games."
Dog water anniversary rewards.
good generous game
Nice
why u doing this to ur all royal player (Kuro) -W this is player friendly- WTH wrong with you- we want u to win not to fail and set some standard in the gotcha space- not to join them what's change KURO !!!!-
"Guaranteed weapon banner, lower pity at 80, cool and meta MC, dynamic fights with amazing animations."
PEAK
I have been playing this game since release but for some reason my account reset and now I have to start over did this happen to everyone else?
bad game. don't waste your time
"I can't get in the game, because it's always crushing, I did it for so so so many times but still the same, I hope it can be fixed, I'll rate this app 5 star after you fix the issue thank you. God how long will this game get fix edit: it's been 6 4 months already but still can't open this game"
i love you kuro!!!!!!
best game ever!
"it's a really enjoyable game with amazing character and unique and different style the skip button is good but I only used it on the side quest the story is difficult to understand but as you progress it became clear and I love the story and I play a lot of gacha game and this game value my hard work, time and grind not just like other gacha game that will give you the character that you don't want so keep up the good work."
Uninstalling. Lost every 50/50 since last year to lingyang. And i spent money on this somemore.
goon gameüëç
"last time I gave 4 star but now I gave 5 star because I'm so satisfied with the gameplay, the rewards and the graphics. Happy 1st Anniversary"
love it
"great gameplay system, a lot of difficulties and challenges, all the cutscene and the story feel like a movie. The gacha system also better than any of the other gacha games."
love this game
Truly a wonderful game The devs are amazing The world is phenomenal The details to everything literally EVERYTHING makes this game come alive ‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è
"Bruh, update size is 20GB on mobile? I did clear all of my other apps for this and still not enough space? I uninstalled WUWA. Please consider optimize the Game size. Even Genshin is 19GB on myobile duh."
Tough competition for other gatcha game ‚ù£Ô∏è
You can't imagine how beautiful she is.
insane luck. I won every 50/50. I love this game
Best game trust me
"Happy 1st anniversary! absolutely worth to play the characters, the gameplay, the open world visuals everything 10/10 and the devs are so kind and generous too."
"[2.3] Bad Rewards The game fully re-downloads every patch, this is annoying. The quest tracker keeps suggesting i do past events rather than current limited ones. Motion sickness. Lack of good 4* character & weapon Predatory echo system Too much grind"
every update patch is too big. always it's around 10gb ++. 1 st anniversary rewards sucks.
"literally joined because of Carlotta I love her so much. This game is very fun and open world, high quality graphics and gameplay"
I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH
"WuWa is such a fun game. there's no such thing as ""meta"" when you build the characters right, and when you have the skills to get the job done."
"First anniversary new review: Great combat, Great characters, good story(not Great but good) some of the awards for first anniversary were lacking but the game fixed all the starting problems I had. keep up the good work."
for first anniversary they give 2 zani in ten pull
good game
"Honestly, as a long-time Hoyo fan, I appreciate Kuro Games for following Hoyo's footsteps when making a game while giving a fresh iteration to it."
This game is really good and f2p friendly unlike many other mainstream gacha. It feels like it's a video game first then gacha..truly impressive and pleased and looking forward to the upcoming updates..
The best

amazinggg gameeee
IF YOU KEEP GIVING ME CHARCOAL.....
"Beautiful, relaxing, perfectly executed. Brilliant game! Edit: Lowering the review. It seems pretty wild how this is the 5th banner that I lost the 50/50 on a new banner. Something is incredibly wrong with the drop rate, and it shows. How can you support a game that is constantly being so harsh to its players? DO BETTER. Incredibly disappointed."
Music on point Graphics and animation can improve in smoothness voice acting on point combat on point
terimakasih game baik
this game is really nice !!! and really good If you play it in a high quality phone it doesnt lag or anything but I'm using a poor quality phone so I have to change the graphics setting to make it smooth also I'm very excited about 2.3 update !!
It's been 1 year and the game is even greater than when it released
best gacha open world
this game is suck
this is just sad
I love the fast pace combat also zani is cool
üî•
"It's the one of the best game I had played in a while , evrything here including gacha , action, exploration, rewards and other permanent rewards are quite compelling. Besides good things there are certain things that needs improvement - 1) I think damage cap and each max substate roll increment. After playing genshin for so long , I am quite compelled by big numbers. 2) Enhancing memory optimization feature. Rest of the things are just fine in the game . Thanks for reading it <3."
love this game
time efficient and good Exploration and puzzles. very good story with sufficient play time
dev listen to us and that make us happy
"Nice game, BUT it takes alot of memory for a game! Nearly 40GB memory for a game?! Here I thought an 8-10GB game I played awhile ago was too much!!... Can it be toned down abit? Is it like all other Chinese apps that takes loads from your memory space on your phone? Because perhaps there are reasons for that much data space taken from your phone?! üëÄ"
love this game
One of the most enjoyable games I've played. Playing this game about a year now. Combat is the thing kept players like me in this game. Visually stunning. Co-op coud be better.
"it always says error, reconnecting even though I'm on lighting fast internet"
this game is good
Thank you for your hard work!
"Please fix the ping of the game, I swear I can't even walk because of the instability of the america server"
Amazing update great anniversary
Love the game played for 10 hours straight on launch. all issues I had have mostly been fixed so in my opinion as far as mobile gacha games go best ive seen.
it's good game better than genshin sorry
Best Rpg game ever!!! Love Cantarella
We're down to 4.3 stars ‚âà.‚âà
Hidup mommy character üòã
wonderful game
very naysu.
"hi, its a great gamee that I've played.. but since the update now why cant i entering the game or even download the application? is this because the new update require more storage and chipset? please answeer and help some of us that are playing in gadget that wasnt as good as others"
"this game great, fun and interactive gameplay. but the camera sensitivity just tu low, even I set it's to highest. I take me 10 swipe just to do 360 rotation."
"well done kuro, well done"
Its now fixed i give it a 5 star now
"I love the graphics so much, the lore and the story is quite neat and emotional. I just love everything about this game, I love how the devs are supporting us and the game too !"
best game ever
I really enjoy this game
ME LOVE IT!!!! the story is so good and the graphics and design is so amazing and perfect but you know sometimes the fps drop unexpectedly but overall perfect and i just wish you release more male character and a 4 star character's that's all
"S23Ultra High all and On all. It doesnt even heat up. Excellent and refreshing playstyle. Very generous compared to another copycat Genshin Impact LOL. After updates, wuwa is now steering towards it's own identity. enjoying the story now eventhough there is a skip button."
"Another generous game from kurogames and I pretty satisfied with the combats and its stories. A little bit laggy and glitches there and there, but I think it's pretty enjoyable for their first open world game. Edit: IT'S PEAK CHAT!"
Its just overall great lol idc what other people say oh and I wish there are more male characters as well im kind of fed up with all the female
best game
"Would've given 5 cuz I love this game . But after the new update, my game crashed multiple times üòï. deleted and reinstalled it but yesterday again it crashed once üòÆ‚Äçüí®. edit : all problems solved, best game ever üî•üî•"
ii kuro keep it up don't listen to greedy players
"best gotcha game, all the characters are enthralling, and the story is phenomenal"
Best Gacha experience on the market
When can we play the game on console üòî
Worst strategy marketing
Good game.
almost perfect but needing mobile optimization
mulusss
peak
One of the best game I've ever played thanks Kuro games advance happy 1st Anniversary wuwa üòçüéâ
"I love this game, but what is so annoying? Every time there was a big patch update, you have to download the whole 18gb game over and over again , is there a way to improve this?"
"In mobile the graphics isn't that good but the developers keep on improving the lags and issues so I'm happy with it, keep it up ü´°"
love the gameplay! but the gb i use is almost 40GB in this game damn! try to optimize the storage
pre download doesn't work. You have to download the update all over again anyway. Also for some reason the game jumps to 40gb during update. Although the game is 22 gb max
"By far my most favorite mobile game. Even starting out it doesn't take long to do your daily routine. It's not as grind heavy as most other gachas. There's always some kind of event going on, especially late game. If you're just starting out save, save, save all mats."
"I love the gameplay it's hard but my luck in those pulls is so salty :), but that's life i will give 5 stars because of the creativity"
cool game
Brilliant
from 2 stars to 5 stars
"Hey kuro, please help.. Its not finishing the verification on the most recent update."
"Good Combat, Good Story, Good Characters, Good MC"
"First anniversary and no 5star selector, the hoyoverse treatment."
"it's a good game with really great graphics, the fight style is good, the environment is really good, story? meh, but i highly recommend the game, best open world that i played yet."
"pre installed for avoiding ""compiling shader""still after update i have to face compiling shader again"
"The combat's fun and the exploration isn't locked behind slot machine characters. The style is also beautiful and so are the models. But the game has an immersion breaking level of female characters as well as a very simple story, including some issues with the pacing."
at first I don't want to play this game specially the ads I get every time I play a mobile games then after getting lots of ads from it. I played and haven't stop since the game has a good animation and story lines. I just hope you bring more characters in gacha because I want to get lady flora(Camellya)ü•∫.I hope you add more dress for the MC. I love this game it deserves more. I appreciate if I get a sponsorship in my small YT channel to promote this gameü•∞
well done dev
good game so good design character love it
A really good game with a really good story line.every character have their own different animation.Even the NPC looks like a 4 Star character.But I think u need a midrange phone to enjoy the game..
amazing game!
because you give me 2 star verina... atleast other character i don't have
"i love how they rendering every character looks HD,even the npc tho so many detail i can see in the game and enjoying every content,thanks kuro u did it getting better than before üëèüëèüòÜ"
Even in High settings the character detail looks blurry
"Started out great, but now is showing signs of predatory kit designs to emphasize pulling while also lacking in actual content variety and story. 3 stars for the skeptics 4 stars for the optimists."
"awesome, gameplay doesn't bore me out, genuinely good animation, and they're collaborating with cyberpunk Edgerunners"
"was enjoying the game and story until Kuro games decided to show their blatant greed with the new character kits being dependant on another SSR to be good, and the terrible shared banners with NO GUARANTEE FOR ANNIVERSARY. REALLY KURO?"
"great game, hope they maintain this level and push more. People should try it have patience and the payoff will be breathtaking."
Amazing character design and gameplay!
"It is so funny and very generous in rewards. 2.2 So PEAK. Cartethiya and Shorekeeper Rover's Wives. No Arguments, it's Just Facts"
Peak absolute cinema
Oh my gawd after tomorrow update i cant even play the game.. Like the game opens.. But whenever i encounter enemy the connection error never stops and my character end up dying.. Cant even play the game now with so much connection error.. Earlier it was ok for me.. Gosh i really dont wanna play now
better than any game for now. But i hope ur story goes to darker theme like the chapter 1
"Happy First Anniversary, Kuro and fellow Rovers!üñ§ü©∂üñ§"
I love the exploration and every character the story is nice too but I'm not a big fan of the fansevice
"Such a breathtaking experience. Beautiful game, beautiful story, and beautiful everything. Except for the flight challenges."
Very Entertaining Game. The Graphics and Gameplay is Great Experience
Best game ever ‚ù§Ô∏è
needs to optimize better for Android. It lags and also power consuming.
it isn't working
"I love the game so much, but the only reason why it is only 3star because the sensitivity is bugging even tho my sensi is 0 its still so high so maybe you can fix it but I love this game"
good game ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§ü´Ç
"thanks for fix the problem, I hope next more smoothly gampelay and more updates"
greatest gacha and mobile game so far. i can describe quests at this game like a masterpiece. the characters are alse interesting and handsome. i absolutely loved it. and if you can play this on PC try you won't be regret this. also need to keep in mind that you don't need to pay any coin for taking enjoyment from gameplay. i hope you will get some happy feelings while playing WuWa;)
i love it
FR better than genshin üíó‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
"happy 1st anniversary, hope the game will more become fun and enjoyable. Please balancing the game and no powercreep."
Amazing game with good features and good developers
"Untuk gamplay, story udah bagus, cuma sayang koneksi selalu jumping naik turun dari ping normal 30-40ms tiba tiba naek ke 600-999ms bikin fps drop, hp panas dan patah parah . Pake wifi / data seluler sama aja, padahal streaming atau main game lain aman aman aja . Bikin gak mood maen nya . Tolong di perbaiki lagi . Terimakasih ."
This kinda bad i think. I downloaded the game and fully downloaded it while its compiling shader it's keeping turning black i dont know why i tried restarting the game but its still turning black
"graphics is amazing, the gameplay is too üòÆ"
I'm pgr player too so no wonder. if there's so many rewardsü§≠üî•üëÄ
"I have been playing for a year every day, but what's this? This feels like genshin so stingy. And the live stream was so misleading."
devs are very generous and respectful of it's players' time
no need to explain play it yourself
"The best game I‚Äôve played so far! The combat style is very creative, story are good too, especially in the new update. Exploration is very easy, you do not need any limited characters because you can just collect echoes and stamina depletion is slow, and the design of the characters are just marvelous‚ú®also, the devs are very generous on rewards and actually listen to players, most bugs/glitch or problems got fixed in just 2-3 days. A very recommended game if you‚Äôre looking for an open-world game"
"the game is great but the mobile controls need improvement. only 2 characters shown in the swap arena so their position becomes unpredictable after swapping twice. the left part of the screen keeps registering movement only so u can't use multiple fingers effectively without miss clicking. I hope the"" tower"" and ""waste"" endgame content gets improved since it's a fight against the clock not the enemies most of the time."
It is better to improve the graphics.
"Truly a goated game, underrated fr"
please.. please... please.... reduce the update data pack... I get low blows trying to update and get back in on mobile
Underwhelming anniversary
great game
"So far good enough,been played for a month and just a minor issue about device coz i use phone. Keep up the good work and Keep improving"
I love KURO GAME... THX FOR HARDWORK
I really love the designs and gameplays of their game but I'm really looking forward for more male characters on the future!
"This is My Review on 2.2 i love The Story its so peak the character expression And the story telling is so good i want more of that can't wait to get Zani Love The Game,Love the Devs‚ò∫Ô∏è‚ò∫Ô∏è"
"game pre-download is too big, like re-download :"""
"it's getting better overtime. The devs listen to players' feedback and try to apply them in the game. You know, unlike that other open world game"
"nice game, beautiful sceneries, wonderful play style."
üòâüòâ
game is fairly optimized but my is s23 fe with exynos 2200 and it sometimes crash
"This game really deserves it. Keep it up, Kuro! I‚Äôm seriously having a blast and can‚Äôt wait to see what more you have in store. Just a little thing though ‚Äî I hope you can tweak the optimization a bit. My device struggles even on medium settings, but that‚Äôs not stopping me from enjoying the game. Thanks for all the hard work!"
The game overall is good but the problem is with when I try to look for blobflys it doesn't respawn in my world.
it's a great game I love the aesthetics and the optimisation is excellent. the gameplay is breathtaking and you'll never get bored
Graphics are amazing if you're using a good device. Character designs are crazy beautiful but sometimes can be too revealing. Love the game overall though. HAPPY FIRST ANNIVERSARY WUWAAA!!!
"I love WuWa it has now since the release, been my favorite open world game. I love how the dev actually listens to the players comments or troubles in game.ü•π Kuro will forever be my favorite game and no other open world game could change that!!‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è (Unless it's another Kuro gameüëÄ)"
"Loved the combat, the system, the animations. But if there's one thing I want to point out is that I wish to see characters interacting with each other even more rather than the player. I want see the depths of the relationship with them and the others. For example the Black Shores, I want to see Shorekeeper and Camellya interacting with each other in the game. The same goes with Carlotta and Cantarella. I want them to at least have a go on each other (a fight). But anyway the game is good."
Damnn!!! The Graphics Are Sooo Improving....
"Great game for mobile standart, but still lack at story"
amazing gameplay but the shity part it's full of fan service and the story is just like an isikai anime
"esta mal optimizado para PC, sin mencionar que para la nueva actualizaci√≥n, la descarga pesa 50 gb en PC, pr√°cticamente descargar el juego nuevamente"
Very slay
"üòçThe best game I have ever played had an incredible story üìñ, stunning graphics üéÆ, amazing details ‚ú®, and so many other great features üéØ. Everything about it was simply outstanding! üòä"
"keep up the good work, it was very fun and emotional experience <3"
I like this story üëçüëçüëç
"Nice gameplay, thanks for gift 30 free pull before anniversary event, I really appreciate that gift"
The best gacha game yet! Shoutout to the devs for actually listening to feedbacks!
"I just really like the game , from character animations to fighting system, the story and scenic animations"
will only get better as time goes on love the game kuro. i was right.
better at all (period)
Pretty boys and girls
"amazing game and gameplay. nothing short of what was expected , am a day 1 player and the only thing I regret is not playing more üòÇ"
"I play from Africa (EU server), and any time I'm about to do any co-op event, I just get sent back to the loading screen"
Day 1 player here Story: Story IMO has become so telegraphed with the foreshadowing too in your face and gets repeated throughout the story. The pacing is decent and the plot is interesting but still needs a bit of subtlety. Gameplay: Wuwa always had great game play but has recently become stale. I don't even bother parrying in most cases because of the endgame modes being time clear based challenge. Fractal vice is fun and I hope for skill based rather than number crunching. ps.bring back IR
i love this game and i recommend it to anyone who wants an anime style game especially with the combat style. try pgr as well
Joystick is very unresponsive to input despite changing sensitivity. Camera gets very glitchy when fighting multiple enemies
I play this game because Danjin
Best gacha game. I have played Genshin Impact and all but this one never bores me.. Just loved it.‚ù§Ô∏è
Don't let the fact that it's a Gacha game or the review bombing fool you. This game is not only incredibly polished but there is a lot of love and care that went into this title. From the very detailed and honestly at times very beautiful character models to the rich and very lively environment that is just filled with lighting effects and overlays really bring out the best of this title. if you have more capable hardware do it. But for a mobile game it is absolutely breathtaking.
"the game's size on mobile is quite large compared to most other games, I would like to suggest some solutions that might improve the experience: Compressing game data Giving players who have already completed the missions the option to clear their data for completed or inactive missions, which helps reduce the overall size without affecting their progress. I believe these measures will greatly help make the game easier to download and update for a wider range of players."
"One of the Best gacha game,W Devs,W Game, Absolute Cinema gameüñêÔ∏èüòàü§ö"
the game is fit for fighting rpg but also need higher phone to enjoy it to bad
nice game
the best anime game
It's SIMPLY THE BEST!
pre downloaded the update and took 42gb of my storage. But now that the update came an issue happened where i cant update the app in the store due to low storage now i gotta reinstall and download all over again in order to update the game.
"10/10 no doubt. The developers are so loving and caring towards the community and its players, which is inspiring and impressive, despite the current drama and criticism it receives. The game is none other than exquisite, the graphics, the characters, and the it's mechanics that makes it more unique, even tho some of us (especially to mobile players) experience a massive frame drop rate and frequent lag, I trust the devs will work and optimize the game to the fullest. We love you Kuro!‚ù§Ô∏èKeep up!"
"this is one of the best games I have ever played, best graphics, combat style, counter attacks, and for new bosses (just added like hecate, dreamless, crownless, have another level of aura and difficult to handle that gives player thriller and challenge."
"everything is good , just need a little more optimisation for mobile devices ."
runs pretty poorly on my phone even with the lowest graphics but aside from that i still love the game. lovee the combat
Amazing Game nothing else to be said just as simple as that and happy anniversary thanks for this banger üòò
"i play PGR, another game made by these devs, they are so sweet and the gameplay is immaculate, for the quality of the game I'm very happy it runs well on my phone. The story quest is genuinely interesting, the characters are unique in their stories and designs, and the exploration is interactive and requires genuine effort I love the echo system too. I can't wait to force my non-gamer friends to play with me üòé"
is a great game with great visual combat is rewarding
"peak game, love you kuro, absolute cinema"
good game
"It has an interesting story, the characters actually care for the protagonist and it actually has unexpected plots the animating is amazing"
"Games not terrible in not having the lagging and crashing issues I've been reading about. the chat button is in a terrible place on mobile, I'm always hitting it while fighting or exploring. for that reason I wont be playing any more. Maybe they get mobile figured out and I can try again but a long as chat button is so close to the movement I'm out."
"Pincer Maneuver Warriors 1 event made me dislike the game. No coop activities, but they release this poorly made event, all for the released character with unobtainable rewards for casual players."
"Update. Follow up to the abysmal anniversary 'rewards' and 24 limited banners framed as a gift, the devs dissapoint again with the highly anticipated character Zani. A 45% damage falloff and proper rotation being unusable unless you have the limited unit Phoebe is simply predatory The gacha is already predatory with 50/50 rates and costing 400+ dollars to gurantee a character. Now the devs begin to lock part of a characters kit behind another limited. Ciaconna/Carthethyia will likely be similar"
"At the end of version 2.2, connection stability improved, but there is still a long way to go to fix crashes and overheating... I hope they improve it in version 2.3, it is an excellent game without a doubt."
i want to build my own house in game please
"I love this game, but sometime it just randomly shuts itself down."
"love this game,keep it up!!"
I just feel like rate it
having so much fun playing this beautiful game...thanks kuro.. plz let me win my 5050 on carlotta
Just optimized it for mobile please.
One of the best Rpg games I've ever played in my life
"It's a really nice game but the game also have a few problems mainly being that it crashes alot and by alot means so much that it gets annoying,atleast for me.Also it takes so much space which is ridiculous.I play other games too on my tab too and they do not take that much space.Aniversary is around and I pre-installed the update but now I can't update on playstore cause it take so much memory like 42GB are u kidding.Other wise I love this game cause I have been playing since day1.Hope they fix"
This game is absolutely cinema
Needs some quality adjustments but still plays well
"Loved it , this should be the new standard for gacha games."
Doesn't feel like anniversary
One of the best Open World games I have played the music is incredible and the views are breathtaking this game is definitely one that belongs at the top.
nice
no hay que decir GOAT
teach your bots to behave and stay on your game we are tired of them
"03.06.24: there is still issues with the ping and fps drop. I can now play longer than before, though the game still force quit/crash."
the best game. it's just need support arabic language üëå
devs are acting nice on multiple aspects when they are having hardship to get support from players and then betray the players' trust on multiple aspect after they are getting successful
"the game is getting ridiculously big for a mobile game, can't even pre-download the next update"
one of the best gacha games of all time and is player friendly too.
The best game that I've played on a smartphone!
"This is the best game ever for me.This graphics,design, character & story is so wowsome üò©üéÄ"
"I like to say sometimes some games will attach to our heart deeply for me it's your game wuthering wave attached to me emotionally I don't why whenever I hear the song ""With Glory I Shall Fall"" I feeling like a particular attraction and emotional attachment towards that song such a meaningful so I like the most and I can wait for the next main quest I hope it will be just like the ""Blessed Maiden"" I don't care about others opinion and as the oldest player I would like to say this game it's cool"
the graphics story action combat everything is peaaaak üî•üî•üî•üî•üî•
we need more male characters and less fanservice and jiggle physique. it's so.. eww.
This is so nice!!! amazing storage is good al is good. the burst effects graphics Fps is so amazing im satisfied. earning astrite's is not that hard if your beginner pulling for character is more easier and there weapon.i can see the effort and hardwork they out on this game.even physics is nice the grass shadows light and other üíÄ. well this game is so good on higher devices but it is good for low devices too thanks for the graphics setting.the game also have puzzle solving too. Œ©/10 GOOD JOB.
The start of this game captivated me so much tbh. I really recommend it
L anniversary
"the game is slowly turning towards pay to win, be it the recent Anniversary reveals which only people who pay can enjoy(12 banners is player friendly? seriously?) or be it the new DoT system which makes it so that the newest and fan favourite character NEEDS another Gacha Character, basically turning into if you want more dps from X you need Y character. or be it the fact that it's almost been a year since game launched and there's only been 2 4* released and both are trash."
Great game
The anniversary rewards are a joke. I really expected more from Kuro. Very disappointed.
"I really love wuwa and even had preregistered it before its release. I had great story and really love the combat sequence in it. I removed a star due to some of the following reasons:- It's kind of too easy to clear story mode(main quest), on mobile the camera during action could be better, frames can be smoother and I hope that you introduce more male characters since too many female characters invite bad fan service. I hope that you work on the above problems and keep improving the gameüòÅ"
Game good but is lags and thay are not anything special to their anniversary. I would love get a special reward. but they are not giving anything thing spacial.
love it
Dope
"It's very fun! Take your time as rushing to lvl 90 will take you awhile. Very generous to new players. ALSO I GOT 2 5* in my first 20 pulls on premium banner, WHAT IS MY LUCK AAAAHH üò≠üò≠SHOREKEEPER, MY SHAYLAA. ZANI PLS COME HOME"
2.2 is peak
god-tier game gacha
"There's a bug on the map of Fagaceae Peninsula, it says that I haven't got all the sonance casket in the region, but I've already collected them all, checked 4 times already, please fix this devs!!! love yall. edit: nvm, I know what I did wrong, btw absolute cinema on how cool that was, the puzzle in this game really makes you work to complete it‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è"
so farr so good
the best game
"No worries, I trust in Kuro games. So should you guys too. If you're having trouble playing, it's either your device is sooo outdated or your skill issues. That's all."
best gacha game i ever played
"absolute cinema, as expected by kuro devs"
best animation game and easy to play
"i love this game, but that tower of adversity is ridiculous, the energy system is trash and i hate it, and i cant even build a team around my favorite element or character because they decided to place an enemy that is IMMUNE to that element, so i cant use the teams i like and i cant even build another team because i DO NOT like any other element or interaction"
This is my favorite Open world game. I enjoy playing this game. But please give us high chance of getting a high crit. rate or crit dmg in rolling sub stat in echo. It so hard to build a strong resonator. I spend a lot of exp. for echo and tuner but still it's so seldom to get a crit rate or dmg. That's why I can't build a strong resonator . And please give a higher chance of drop rate to acquire an echo boss with crit rate and crit dmg.
Worst game of my life
awesome WHAT ‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°‚ô°
"Other than the unnecessary fan service the game has, for me this game is still great! my device can handle the game quite well it doesn't lag as much as before compared to the past patches. my only concern is there aren't much make characters I hope they equalize the ratio of the male and female characters that's all."
Great game. Great Graphics. Fast to respond with fixing what needed to be fixed. Keeps getting better. Please continue doing this. Gameplay with dodging and parry feels really good and satisfying. I don't really have any issue. My suggestions are written in surveys but if I have to mention something. The storage requirement is a lot and a few optimizations for lower end devices would be nice.
so KURO you guys are following MIHOYO now is that it wth with new contents having a very hard time clearing everything with old characters l guess powercreep has started
best game gurliesss
"while Wuthering Waves is a great game that has astounding graphics, breathtaking music, and lore-rich (if you care to read the logs collected), the engine in the making of this game is not graphics-friendly to mobile users, as it's unreal engine and it's known for being capable of making astonishing graphic 3D textures. Optimization is really needed for the mobile demographic, including me."
"This is a Great game, but updates are massive-often 15-20GB . For mobile players, it's unsustainable. I hope you could fix this issue. Other than that amazing gameplay and cut scenes."
"ngl, 'tis THE best open world rpg gacha game out there!! atleast from the ones I've played so far..."
"The graphics and the gameplay is very amazing. But the issue I'll point out is the optimization, please optimize the game much better kuro it would be much appreciated."
Absolute cinema ‚úãüòØ‚úã
Good
"After 2.0, the game became quite literally unplayable. The little bit of improvement in optimization that we got went out of the window"
good game if you have a mobile with good spec
"Changed my rating from 5 to 4 stars due to the disappointing rewards for the first anniversary. As a day 1 player, I feel like the rewards for the first anniversary are really bad but overall the game is still great. I hope they fix the issues with the anniversary soon as it is clearly overshadowing their whole year of hard work and dedication towards the game and its player base. Edit:- Changed to 1 star, since even after all the feedback from players they didn't fix anything in the anniversary"
thank you kuro üíØ
my fon is crash
I hope you guys optimize wuwa on tablets like Samsung I lagged so bad that it crashed
"Hands Up. probably the best MMORPG I played love the storyline but it's just low-key short hopefully we get a longer storyline also I like the voice lines and W for zani, can't wait"
"It's really awesome and has a great combat system, great graphics, great world exploration, great characters, etc. It's a really good game."
Amazing game i love camellya ‚ù§Ô∏èü•∞
worse anniv reward annoucement...the event is cool tho
weak anniversary
"After playing this game and Genshin, now i know, this the the BETTER GAME, Genshit ain't got nothing on this."
As an HSR escapee it feels quite good being treated as a human.
"Gotta change the rating, Mobile optimisation is bad, It was okay from 1.3 but now it's back to frame drops and lagging, for me atleast"
"Wuwa is the best gacha game and will be best in future. Every thing from exploration ,character designs, gameplay mechanics , end games, etc are so much fun and I enjoy it very much. I very much appreciate the game devs form making the game."
"very fun, interactive, good gameplay... too bad my phone is having some lagging issues due as it ain't that powerful but overall this game really gave me a good time"
this game is give me this what is wrong with you dev why you give a lot of internet my phone almost crash
love the game but its to high performance for my phone even all lower graphic setting the game is lag im cry cry cry
good
Peak combat
bad anniversary
"I'm leaving a bad review as someone who has been a huge Kuro supporter and got my friends into it. I'm leaving a bad review because it feels like I have to. From the bad anniversary roll out with the company heavily favoring new and returning players as well as hedging out any F2P players with their lack of 4 stars, creeping glitches and the pervasive feeling of semi-betrayal. I love the story, the gameplay feel and the graphics as well as characters and their designs‚Äîbut can't recommend rn."
The best gacha ever. I'm saying this as a 1.0 genshin impact and 1.0 of honkai impact /starrail /ZZZ player.
what the
i like how the dev listen to the customer complain and make the game better in just 1 year bit we need more male characters
is this the game where the anniversary feels just like any other patch and is not worth pulling on?
are y'all truly even working on the crashing issues or just messing around üòï it's been months since I could play this game and I still try but every time I can't enjoy it because it crashes üò≠üòî
"Love you, Kuro! Seriously, you guys listen to the players, and it shows. You always do your best to assist everyone and make the game better. I truly appreciate the hard work your team and employees are putting in it‚Äôs not easy, but you‚Äôre doing an amazing job. I enjoy your game, it‚Äôs creative and fun, but maybe just a little more optimization on mobile would make it even better! Thank you for caring about the community. Keep shining, and keep believing in what you‚Äôre building!"
"3 reasons why I give 5 stars on this game, first is this game is really realistic it's makes me think that I'm the mcüòÖ, second, this game is better than other game like Genshin Impact, I don't know in others think but for me this is better than other game. lastly I feel comfortable on this game, the graphics, animations, the characters and etc. I full in love on this game so much that's why kuro games don't make me dissapointed. that's all..."
"I love this game, never had any issues with it even with the anniversary stuff going on around, I think people are overacting with down voting it so much."
"when I update my game all the download data inside the game is deleted automatically. then I have to download all data from the beginning, ü§∑üèª‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è"
"Kuro, can you please make the lag go away, the new update is beautiful, but the lag has increased,please fix it.... I hope you will notice this."
Best mobile game fs the graphics the characters are so so beautiful ‚ù§Ô∏è and it's free just wow I'm in love with this game.
"So far, pretty good."
"I really enjoy playing this game but because I'm playing this on mobile, every update needs like 15GB for it to download the resources and my phone can't quite handle that so now I just uninstalled it. I hope this will change soon cuz other games don't need that much storage when updating and downloading their resources."
amazing game but needs a bit more optimisation
"been playing since launch. (made me addicted to it that it even made me play pgr) the only common criticism I have is the optimization for mobile users, who is low on storage and has poop wifi. overall satisfied with it's gameplay and visuals. will forever look up for further improvements. ‚úÖ‚úÖ"
"I used to love this game until the anniversary rewards dropped. I know u alrd giving out free char, skin, weapon. but that was previous patches. If u count those good deeds, what's the point of anniversary then? 2.3 is a good regular patch, but bad anniversary patch. With the same treatment I'd rather go back and play genshin."
"I absolutely love how generous this game is. I played since 1.0 and I still play Wuwa until today. eventhough I am late to review, and even if the anniversary rewards I kind of small... I still love this game."
"Man this game is fire. I've never seen a gacha game mechanics like this one. This game has the best battle mechanics. But there is only one problem. This game doesn't run so smooth. lately it has become laggy, where my device is capable of running this game at high graphics settings."
I think this is ok
can you guys add a type of gacha where you can pull 5 star char based on their attribute that would be changed weekly so that I could atleast have higher chance to get that specific character or atleast the same attribute and would save my pulls T-T
love it but 45gb is OUTRAGEOUS. please allow us to delete past quest resources or something to make it easier for us brokies who cant afford high quality gaming computers or advanced technology with 256gb of space
playable game
another fanservice character followed by unnanounced censorship I'm done with this game
literally one of the most generous gacha games I've seen if you like open world games with stunning combat visuals this game is for you
need more optimization in mobile
"Limited character upgrade materials being story region locked is diabolical. Also, I was stuck at the dragon flying quest for days - there was a new update but it affected very old gameplay somehow."
This game doesn't deserved to be reviewed bombed. The devs do a lot for the community especially compared to other games.
"it's nice to play, needs some software updates to make it smoother, but overall rllly nice"
Absolute Cinema
Peak Gaming Right Here Fellas üóø
The game will go down the same direction as Honkai Star Rail with how the anniversary rewards are. Punishing Gray Raven was extremely generous with their 5th anniversary to celebrate their players and it's owned by Kuro Games. The anniversary of Wuthering Waves seems like a premium filler patch sprinkled with extra rewards. the rewards are rather lackluster when you think about how they are gonna release 12 character banners in 2.3
"As a gamer who enjoys visuals and appreciate good character desings plus the good story telling, i see this game doing great in the coming days . Thank you KURO for this Masterpiece"
it's Fun
"Absolutely in love with this game. Had to travel and got the game on my phone. And it runs so damn well. Plus the fact that they keep improving and listening to the player base consistently. With each patch the game keeps rising higher. The game does need some optimization but overall, gameplay and QoL improvements are satisfying. Really sad alot of people are rating it low because their device can't run the game. 10/10 Combat and Exploration."
"The developers are actively listening to the player base and it's a good direction they are going,good qol and it is actually very f2p because they are generous with the gacha currency,i only have one request that is for mobile players like myself we just need a option to delete past quest resources like we have in genshin impact that we don't need anymore so we can have more storage for the updates in the future.Except that they are doing very good with the game."
great game but it makes device overheats at performance settings (low ) i don't know what causing this but i tried all settings same results same overheating problem you need a strong induction cooler to play this game everything is great wish i can play this without a cooler for hours
"epic but very laggy, I hope you optimize the game"
Amazing game
wasted male character desing fr. why would you make the most peak desing to just waste them
it is my favorite game but I can't play it smoothly and it consumes over power. the graphics it recommends are balanced but I'm playing it in ultra performance but it is still lagging Please clear this issue I want to play this game without any problem and laging ü•∫ü•∫
cool game
"gorgeous game, beautiful story, and the char models??good lord, the details, im in love"
I played it for a while then it was LAG so hard and the server was in the SEA region like I had a good WiFi connection!!!
bad anniversary rewards üòû
Good for now
very good
I love it it's verygood
absolute cinemaüôå
the game experience is amazing but please add a part in the settings that we can delete the past resources that will never used again It is so important for mobile players who have limited storage
"it's a good game with next level of graphics. this game's character,echo and weapons design are top notch with the the epic story telling. but it doesn't run in low end device so I hope in future update they allow game to smooth with low end device"
Genuinely a great experience. Especially the animations and graphics. the resolution is a bit low but can't fully blame them
i would give better reviews but my phone can barely even play this even after I got 12gb left it still can't handle it and i wanted to pull for zani so bad
Plz keep the good work kuro & always listen to ur playerüëçüèª
The creator of this game really spoils us thank you so much for all the free draw that you been giving us this is the first rpg that gaves so much free stuffs I love the graphics and the story the characters are coming close to realistic üòçüíãüíã
"I‚Äôll wait for the 3.0 patch. If this game still panders to incels with their ""gathering wives"" plots and doesn‚Äôt release more male characters with interesting and good plots, I think Kurogames will become my most hated developer. I already got burned by PGR after playing since its launch, I don't want to go through the same disappointment again.."
Continue a great work Wuwa
"this is a NICE game, i love the graphics and the character designs and the stories, and i love how this is a free world. this game felt like i was playing a premium game."
Rated 5‚≠ê for this game because of it's quality and developers are actually listening unlike those H-.The story telling in 2.2 is just perfect the quality of characters and even NPCs are majestic! This game is Absolute Cinema! Edit: Pls optimize the game further! I kept getting laggier and laggier
"I'm a returnee, I pre-register & played a little back in 1.0 but I wasn't impressed and uninstalled though I did however keep an eye on what's happening through every patch. 2.0 got my attention so I decided to give Wuthering Waves another try...and man what a blast 2.0 has been. everything is way better than what I remembered in 1.0. My gripe now is storage management, every time a new patch coming pre-install is always 15GB+ I'll leave 4* for now, would be a 5* if pre-install less than 10GB."
very good game
I love this game
Kuro never disappointed me
it's not working in my mobile it's not open
"game playstyle is very unique and very enjoyable for those who want more than just simple attacks the grapple is a perfect touch. But my problem is the optimization of this game even at lowest Its still leggy from a simple walk or attacks ""It because you have a potato phone!"" still atleast make it accessible and enjoyable for those who can't afford good phones, but overall this is a very unique game! I love the designs and I hope this gets fixed so more satisfied players !"
"fun combat, but mini game puzzle is 6.5/10, I hope more type of minigame in future"
"Amazing combat, amazing character and super friendly with the rewards."
"Great game, but LAGGY AF"
Most generous gacha game in the industry
"Best on overall graphics, Insane combat mechanics and no powercreep characters unlike other gacha games. Keep up the good work Kuro!!"
I Like this game so much the characters are fun to play story is also good but the only problem is that it is not optimised for mobile all other gacha games I play run smoothly on my mobile expect Wuthering waves please fix the frames drop and lagging issues üëç
"The game is amazing, but the mobile version needs optimization as there is too much lag. Edit: I will update the review once the issue has been resolved. Edit 27/05/25 Still no signs of optimization and the game load got even bigger"
very epic
I love this game
"The game is really good, the story gets good after a while so please don't give up on it at the start. The devs are really nice, they have included many features which other gacha games sadly never did, guess they really listen to their playerbase. Also the game is very generous, they give away ample rewards. Hats off to you Kuro games."
"I really like this game and would recommend it to my brother, but I have a concern about the exaggerated jiggle physics on the female characters. I understand that some movement is realistic, but it feels overdone. I‚Äôd appreciate it if there were an option in the settings to turn off or tone down the jiggle physics. That way, players can choose what they‚Äôre comfortable with. Thanks for considering! üòÅüòÅ"
good
AMAZIIINNGG
beautiful and amazing gameplay. best mobile game.
mantep banget cuy üòéüòéüòé
Very good! I very love the exploration in this game!
"Thank you Kuro, üî•game"
"before I even loaded in the game, it crashes almost instantly. I have tried even rebooting and getting a new device."
max star my review cuz Zani is coming and I am too
good
"It is so good, but it is so laggy. I've asked my other friend if he's played Wuthering Waves but he told me it was so laggy. He's in PC meanwhile I'm in Mobile. Edit: It was a peak gameplay until you met your downfall. At this point, you should just label this as a harem romance, that would've been more fitting. Female and Male designs are incredibly distinct, yk what type of players this is aimed for. Not a fan anymore. Dropped game."
Best game
"This is the best game on the store. Very good combat, amazing visuals, very challenging (I'd say bordeline unplayable for noobs), story gets better with every update, more features and qol updates every update and amazing devs that actually care about the players and listen to their feedback"
"Hasn't played for months and now went back to play again then gacha-ed to get Jinshi in 80 pulls. Unfortunately, I got Encore instead Jinshi. Accurate gambling rules, 5/5 (The combat is remarkable, yet the storyline imo is like the typical ""Let's save the world!"" But idk, maybe it was just Me who skipped everything, sometimes it's good) Btw ngl, giving the conclusion of the conversation when skipping some conversations is amazing, saves a lot of time for me. (world exploring feels rewarding)"
Happy 1st Anniversary! Welcome Home Zani! üòâ
just bad
bruh why is my game 41 gb after 4 gb pre download
Love this game! everything about it is exceptional
farming the echoes to get a perfect one is a bit hard but other than that it's good
"This game have a good story sometimes, and bad af sometimes. This game have a awful optimization, even in proper devices they recommend. I already play in pc and mobile version with recommend specs they gave, but cant even stable in 60fps."
I have a snapdragon 870. I downloaded this game 4 months back but had to delete it because there was a lack of optimization. I downloaded it again today and faced the same optimization issue it lags or just freezes whenever I get into combat and the internet disconnects that's why I don't feel like playing it. I hope in the future when I return it will be super optimized and don't have any internet disconnect issues. For now giving 1 star so the development team works on the issue.
"I'd Rate the game 5 stars because Of the High End Gameplay and Quality throughout the whole Game, The problem is it quite lags even if my storage is pretty high, it still lags"
"Great game, but there's one thing that you guys have to do, can you make the render distance more far??? i played this game with highest graphics and i'm pretty annoyed about the render distance, and also can you guys add more Resolution on resonator clothes, thank you"
optimize the game please
love it
first anniversary gifts are very disappointing
best story game ever.
"the game Is not at all optimised for Android, it becomes laggy after every new update."
better than some console game
"I just finished doing the pre download, but now it takes 41gb space and not 22gb like usual. will it come back to 22/23g or gonna stay in 41gb?"
The goat in gatcha gaming
Excellent game.
They just added pre-download best game ever
Probably the best gacha game you can ever play
great
it has beautiful world than genshin
Nice
I love it
Fix ur gacha system game I can't win 1 50/50 Im quiting I'm going back to ginshin
"The game is so satisfying but the storage that needed is too much, making it harder for other players to play. I hope the storage that is needed can maybe optimize and not laggy."
An extremely awesome experience and the things you get to do in this game are certainly plenty and varied particularly well. The big highlight is the sekirolike combat (dodge & parries) that will certainly give players a challenging yet rewarding experience.
you cannot delete the previous quest so your storage will fill up and you can't update the newest patch
edit : perfect!!
good job guys thanks for this beautiful game !!!!
"not very mobile friendly, lagged alot"
Zani Uwooghhhhh
The game doesn't open it keeps crushing please fix it
for the love of god optimize the game for low end mobile phone players
hell yeaaah
i love the girls !!‚ô•(‚úø‡∏∫¬¥‚àÄ`‚úø‡∏∫)Ôæâ‚ô•(‚úø‡∏∫¬¥‚àÄ`‚úø‡∏∫)Ôæâ
"The game itself is good, but it still lags A LOT on my Samsung tablet. To the point where it is almost unplayable to me. It works a little better on the phone but you still risk overheating. (this is my experience on the LOWEST graphic settings available)"
good
A game that treats their player base PROPER!!! We'll see if they can recover from 1st yr anniversary drama
cant even play with the lowest graphics... Worst game ever.. I get better performance with better graphics on genshin
"5/5 after buying a new phone I can enjoy the game so much but I'd like to mantion in some regions I get frame drops from 60 to 45 so fix it :) , tysm for making the game more smoother for the mobile players"
fps drops
"horrible gacha system, even after finishing everything to 100% and spending 150‚Ç¨, I still couldn't pull the resonator I wanted. keep getting useless resonators like Verina, whom I will never play with. and game developers just keep releasing sexualized female characters and never any male characters. Basically, this game has just evolved into another genshin impact ripoff. so disappointing :/"
Perfection
Absolutely Beautiful game. Love the game and love the devs
"I honestly love this games lore, gameplay, characters and animations I also love how it doesn't crash my phone whenever I play it"
Best game ever created
geshu Lin please

"This was a great game with a generous developer, but they've slowly started walking back their generosity as it got more popular, trying to squeeze as much money out of players as possible. For a game with core gameplay aspects (characters) locked behind expensive transactions (can cost ~$400 if you're unlucky), it's inexcusable to start skimping players on the free resources provided that made the game enjoyable despite the predatory monetization."
I got shorekeeper
game crashes when I open the game
best game ever^^
it is amazing. Game to play it have interesting story and adventure
Great game with great experience. Great dev team too.
nice
I had stucked inside the room please response by feedback in game
realy enjoying this game and yeah I am good with the anniversary reward kuro game provided. thankyou kuro game's ‚ô•Ô∏è
"I love everything about WuWa. My main and biggest issue is them taking away my 5 dollar coupon I used to get. I'm not sure who to blame between the ChiChi Communist Panties or Ten Cents of rubbish of company that has nothing better to do than to ruin a gamers day. Or maybe Kuro games is slowly becoming greedy (which I highly doubt) but whoever pushed for my couple to be deleted just wants Kuro to go away. Sussy Baka behavior! Thanks for everything, regardless! I always forget WuWa is a gacha!"
"this game is best of all time. the mechanism and battle style is very impressive and wonderful. all places are very photo- realistic and stunning!!! but if the game developers put a cyberpunk type city in the map, it would be more fantastic. their are several cities i know but they didn't too big and didn't feel cyberpunk type. soo please add a cyberpunk type city üôèüôèüôèü•∫ü•∫"
Review-1: Best game ever. Genshin could never. Review-2 : Greed consumes all. Review-3: Wake me up when Lupa's here.
"you know the deal, anniversary"
goood
"Graphics saying overloaded bothers me but the fact that im still playing smoothly is amazing. Though I do play on 40fps to be safe. I love the story especially Rinascita, im all but satisfied. Love ya Kuro."
"Login mobile hanya lagi diluar rumah, kudos kuro"
masterpiece game but some lags issue ruins it.
"the best life services game ive ever play. idk how to express that, like this game is so peak imo. im really appreciate kurogames as the developer, they really think about their players, their games, and their services. i really love that, i hope u guys can be consistent to update this game to a more more better game."
"The game would have been perfect like a fresh white linen but the stain? The story. We wake up memoryless, thrown into jargon with zero buildup. Characters orbit the protagonist like satellites, and the constant ""Rover glazing"" makes it feel more like an Otome game. Every area follows the same tired loop: Sentinels cause problems, clingy characters, and vague promises that memories fix everything. Villains feel like mosquitoes‚Äîeasy to squash and easy to forget. This world deserves better story"
Best gacha game
"The battle gameplay is on a whole new level, dare I say the best in gacha games. Gorgeous character designs and fighting styles. Game runs super smoothly on my new phone, no lag and crazy good quality. Recent updates been really good, love the new area designs. There is a lack of male characters, which is a shame, but the ones we have make up for it. I'm hopeful the Devs will even out the ratio in future patches, they tend to respond to feedback very well. Seriously a 10/10 game."
"runs like hell, even on lowest graphics."
I played the new companion quests. the stories themselves weren't too bad. but the amount of times the characters get touchy feely and flirty with Rover is CRINGE worthy. it's not bad on its own. but it feels forced. I've had enough of that. the MC feels insincere because of all those interactions. and the characters themselves feel like a copy of each other. i can't find myself getting attached to any of these characters. besides that. everything else about the game is perfect
yeah...

I had lost 50/50 3 times continuouslyüò≠üò≠
Please partner with Google Play for more rewards!
"wow, gooner game"
"It ALWAYS crashes, especially in the middle of battle. I'm using a flagship phone. S24 to be exact. It's almost been a year since the game launched yet it's still buggy. Fix it!"
"I love this game so much! I don't know why people are so greedy like can y'all get a life?? they are working so hard to make all the greedy players satisfied, all of you should be ashamed. Kuro shouldn't have to listen to some greedy players especially the people who are ungrateful, I guess this is what happens if you listen to people, being nice to them, and giving everything they want. Keep it up Kuro!! sometimes it's okay not to listen to others feedback<3"
My favorite game
Good quality Good animation Good everything
"good game, good anniversary reward, immersive story, great combat system, everything about u is good"
"takes a lot of time to download the resources, I can't even leave the app, Had to stay there for 3 whole days just for it to be download. and no it's not my signal, it's pretty well. fix that please."
"10/10. The game is good, The dev team is better. They balance each other. Been a player since day 1. ü§çü§çü§ç"
The game is perfect ü§©but it can't be optimised for Meditatek processor Dimensity 8300ü•≤ü•π mobile

It's wonderful game
that's game so amazing dude
pretty good combat and effects
This changed the gacha space... In. A good way
Best Gacha Game ever. even with all the backlash you have received recently I will atill support you Kuro because you deserve it.

"W, This is so player friendly"
I like the game and chapters design are really good too
"thank you solon lee for making this game, i love it bro"
laggy
"I've been playing wuthering waves for quite some time. I loved the game and played it everyday until one day when I opened the game I was signed out. I logged back into my account in the American server, because it's the server I play on and it completely made me restart the game all my progress I made was lost I don't have the same characters anymore which I don't understand. Please fix this problem."
good game with fantastic gaptaphics
"This is an amazing game, clearly alot of care was put into making this game. they clearly care about their players and listen to what people dislike and like, which make me respect kuro games alot, even since punishing gray raven they still keep up to my expectation. but i have seen people come a review bomb wuwa over an aniversary that hasnt even come out yet because of leaks that were outrageously false and quite thick in the head people decided to believeit nonetheless keep it up kuro games."
"I really love how the developers make improvement in every patch. im a 1month player but i receive a lot of generous rewards and Characters already. For this is on a top tier F2P game i played in gacha games i played. Thank you devs, keep up the good work and create more interactive events that we can enjoy."
nice
Bad optimization
perfect ü´¶
An Absolutely Amazing Game.....Loved It
banyak game yang saya mainnin. game ini saja yang bagus sekali
The boss are very powerful than character
my fav game!
"The gacha system is terrible, they just want you to keep spending and do more pulls, game also lags sometimes and it ain't that much better than Genshin"
"great game but need some serious optimisation, the story is average and gameplay is great, but the game will crash every ten minutes, I've played games more intensive and haven't had this problem, so I have to log in every ten minutes because the game randomly closes."
"The game is very very good, but please add setting to adjust text size. I have a bit of difficulty reading the subtitles, is kinda small"
i just wish my phone wouldn't heat up if I play the gameüòû
Absolute cinema! Massive W game! Thank you so much for this incredible special gaming experience :'))
"Combat mechanics are decent, story so far is good, just need a lot of optimization framedrop while playing this game is no joke, also unstable connection. Bro please optimize this mobile version, after 2.2 fps drop is almost unplayable in a certain area"
the game graphics is next level is story also i love this game and female characters
best game

best graphic and the story but for me I always support no matter what I play
GAME TERBAIK SEPANJANG MASA!!. once human game jelek.
good but should be optimised for mid end device
Always gets stuck at 75% Loading Screen.
"This is a great game! I quit a certain game because the developers lacked communication with their audience. However, this game, on the other hand, truly listens to the worries and concerns of the community, which makes it far better in my opinion. I just hope you can add an option to delete past mission resources and include lower graphic settings for low end phones."
"With how allergic the Devs and certian loud players are of male characters, as well as how all the female characters just fall head over heels for the MC at first sight, it's basically just gathering wives at this point. Don't play if you like playing male characters, they're basically nonexistent. And if you DO like female characters then most of them are oversexualized to the point it's just a turn off"
"every thing is well good. the stores , graphics, world build and a lot of them. I like the system Macanisum of this game. dodging, counter attack they are just amazing. everything well and good. but the graphic isn't good. even with a Snapdragon chipset including good mobile this graphic is just can't run well on it. I wish that the graphic and fps pls go well. so that's. but still they are wifus so 5star....."

"I love the fact that the devs always listens to players feedback and will always appreciate it but, I'm very disappointed on my fellow players just because the anniversary rewards weren't what they expected(yeah read more unofficial leaks you idiots) but overall I love Wuwa and hope it keeps improving every update :>"
Noah Jones Abad: This game is Magnificent and Beautiful. I'm grateful for y'all making this game
"im trying to love it but optimization is so bad,even though I can run genshin smoothly,I encounter this issue a long time ,I read other review ,""The DEVELOPER DON'T LISTEN ""guys those from mid to low end device ,this game is not found us ,Dev ONLY CARE HIGH END DEV CUSTOMER not us so it's better we boycott it"
"okay, so..why is there co-op if we can't even explore together? For example, moving those things to do the puzzles , I mean even if it's allowed only by the owner of the server, it'll be way more fun rather than just be restricted for both , like cmon should we just fight..? It's so fun to play and 'explore' with friends and others yet we're not even allowed that , and don't even get me started on the chat , like when I open it , it lags so hard and it sends me to the top , messages aren't sendi"
"I like wuwa and all, but i installed it for fun and to play with my friend . It has interesting lore , story and characters, but why is it when im chatting with my friends in co-op. it makes me go at the top of messages , like no , i dont wanna see the top (of the chat) , i wanna say something in the current situation , and sometimes it replaces old messages too and its really laggy to chat..can we fix this...did no one notice? are wuwa players really that friendless? (hoping it's fixed soon)"

Anniversary Rewards is Disappointing but I love Qol Updates
Wuwa is great I play it on PC and console mostly its great on console but on laptop lags a little so optimization for lower end devices could be better but everything else is great
"Jesus Christ 2.2 quest was one of the best story I've ever played in video games ever. I was Awestruck. Stunning environment. Beautiful music. It like that meme ""I gota tell you, it was perfect, everything, down to the last minute details"" üî•üî•"
best game hands down!
bad anniversary rewards
I come to play your game because a specific reason and that are ORV and Cyberpunk Edgerunner (your game is one of the greatest game I play just only some point that I feels like I was lost during the game)
Excellent work üíØüëè
"A very generous game ""Zani pls come to me"""
I don't like the Piamon rip off I was expecting something darker from Kuro not the from the deep end (PGR) of dark story writing to the kiddie pool (WuWa)
the game is best for mee
it's good ngl
I love the gane so far the developers are being si generous from all the rewards from the all the event they make and some big awards from teh players. So I'm gonna give a five-star.
"Enjoyable mechanics and story as usual from kuro. Been playing since release and so far I'm happy with all the development. Mostly playing it on the pc with controller so I can use ultra hd on this one. Looking forward to further updates! Update: character design getting boring, felt too cash grab... I'm dropping this game."
Want to play male characters? They don't exist. Want a good story? Not here.
one of the best game
toriq himel is responsible for this one star
not absolute cinema anniversary but we up i get zani
"The game is fundamentally a ripoff of other titles in its genre with no creativity whatsoever. Aside from fast paced gameplay, it offers absolutely nothing. The story isnt well thought out even after a complete rework, which is straight up laughable. Dialogues are poorly written and characters dont even try to act real. Font choice is bad, walking and sprinting animations feel clunky, and the UI is awful. It caters to hardcore fans rather than casual players who draw the most."
my second best anime game
Very beautiful starting from the world and characters and ending on main storyline and beautiful cutscenes. Bugs there and here but a game is new will be fixed and devs are one love very generous and listen to playerbase) Edit: The anniversary was a letdown and I wasn't very satisfied...
"Hi , I hope you can make the game less laggy and reduce the crashes. I've been crashing alot lately, I hope this can be fixed for smooth and better gameplay for all of us."
Needs more optimization in mobile but still BEST GAME EVEEERRR!!!
"Absolute cinema. We thank you for all the generosity and consideration y'all have given us Rovers from the beginning. And we hope to continue this journey with you as well! This game has been a joy ride and will probably continue to be, I've played since release and it's awesome! But the problem is the characters, I don't think too much revealing bodies are necessary for females right? and speaking of females, why are there mostly female characters?"
"Keeps buffering and indicating that there is a loss in internet connection during gameplay. Ruins the experience, since I have played WUWA since launched and have taken a break. Now it keeps disconnecting for a bit."
"Wuthering Waves is hands-down the best game I've ever played! The devs are amazing responsive, listening to feedback, and constantly improving the game. No disappointments here! Hoping for more updates, optimizations, and features, especially to help newer players catch up. I love this game so much üò≠‚ù§Ô∏è, characters and everything üìà! Although devs shouldn't spoil much to players who are too greedy"
shore keeper in the first 10 pull just started the game because of her model
best game ever
game baik
I play on PC but this game is just too good
"If you like censorship, greed, and a total lack of respect for the playerbase‚Äîgo ahead, play it. Big. L."
"I love Wuthering Waves, please give me Shorekeeper üò≠üò≠ ü¶ã"
Peak
"This game is just fan service at its finest, made for the male gaze and the male gaze only. it's seriously disappointing considering how much potential the game has. Seriously, do better. and don't even get me STARTED on the ""jiggle physics"" it's just so unnecessary. Plus, as seen with Cantarella (or whv u spell her name), certain features are just so unrealistic, and some things are best left un-added. This is just a gooner game made for men. would NOT recommend it at all."
I like it
awesome game
"Great gacha game.The combat mechanics are complicated yet are easy to learn,it looks cool also.The game devs are generous also,back then I thought the ones I see in the videos are fake until I've seen it for myself.Overall,good game!"
wow just all boss
This game is goodüòÄüòäüëç.this game is better after update and hitting issues not fixedüò°üò°üò°ü§¨. Everything is not bad but goodüòÄ.this game is hitting issues in 8gb ram android device üò°üò°üò°ü§¨ü§¨ü§¨üò°üò°üò°pleaseüôèfix this issues( my device processor - exynos 1280).
This game is cooking dawg
I love the gameplay and the mechanics of the game it so much fun
Anniversary Rewards Didn't Reach My Expectancy
"I absolutely ADORE this game to pieces. The graphics are stunning, I love the lore, characters and the world building. But since the 2.0 came out I cannot play it for longer than 10 minutes at a time. I had to set my graphics to the lowest of low and even then it says they're too high for my device. I didn't have that struggle before 2.0. My game is constantly lagging ever since. I cannot open up the in game news or the banner history without the game closing. Pls fix this for mobile players."
"I'm going to review this on my personal phone, I play in my gaming phone and just from the beggining of the game I already know this game is peak the animation is so good and beautiful."
the combat was amazing and also the world was absoulutely stunning
the universe award is pretty enough. That's what wuwa player deserve. ÂæàÊä±Ê≠â ‰ªäÂ§© Âè™ÊúâÊú¥ÂçöÂì≤ ÂèØ‰ª•ËøõÂÖ•
this game is very nice like genshin and zzz and honkai I recommend you play it
"The disrespect you have for how you display women body. As a female myself, this is unacceptable and disgusting. And the unrealistic jiggling on female characters, that's unacceptable at all! Any wise female would say that and agree to what I am saying."
1 Year anniversary rewards and stream were underwhelming. Checked some info and the anniversary patch has less rewards than 2.0. unacceptable behavior from kuro. Changing to 3 star because the presentation videos for the units are next level.
Its good
"The best game ever! even tho my phone is potato i can still enjoy the game, not coop tho, but it's all fine! please keep up the good work dev! we'll wait for your surprises!"
"I think, this is a very good game. Great design and lore, but just a heads up the majority who plays wuwa is for the male characters. I think there should be a balance between male and female characters and it's coming clear that right now the females are being favored. So please consider your options and I'm not the only one complaining, majority of people complain in social media. Keep your promise about making the players happy not your sales."
good games
Like the game.
"It's a gacha game. However if you can get over the usual FOMO, the gacha is pretty generous compared to others. The game part is also really good. I would not go so far as to say it's triple A quality yet but it has inproved significantly since launch, offering contents for both casual and hardcore players Minus 1 star because of 50/50 system"
Peaküî•
i keep crashing in the 2.2 version rn..
"The developers are extremely passionate about the game. They put a lot of effort even in the tiniest, most unnoticeable details. From the characters' emotions, gestures, and accents to the mob interactions in the open world and environment design, you can really tell that they care about the game. Not to mention the seamless traversal which is a lot better than most open world RPG. Finally, the devs listen to their playerbase which is the most important thing."
Waifu fanservice is the best!
"Awesome, simple awesome. Could go for more optimization though. But all in all, AWESOME. EDIT: Just editing to clown on people who complain for SELFISH REASON. Imagine being so greedy you review bomb kuro for better rewards. All of you should be ashamed of yourselves. Dont listen to them kuro, especially you my boi solon lee. Just keep doing what you feel is right. Wish y'all the best!!"
"amazing game, don't listen to the losers review bombing the game"
dev listen to community and each update has good game changes
the best
Wuhu
"Its getting better & better. The new flying utility is awesome because stamina don't drain fast, very satisfying to use when exploring. This game gives best combat experience, best exploration, and the cutscenes and NPC design is way much better than the other one out there. The story and cutscenes is getting more exciting every update. We need more source of tuners, bcuz TF gives little. This game need better optimation for mobile ASAP. The Whimpering waste is only the worst, need rework."
"quality, mechanic, and graphics so hot"
ignore the beggars this game has good quality content
"please fix the mobile gamer experience üôè, it's too laggy"
cool as game
love u.
the best
Good game great graphic
"Censorship added without warning, purchased products replaced without compensation, devs attempted to gaslight the issue away claiming the original product was a ""bug"". If you feel victim to this, simply issue a chargeback on your Astrite purchases. Kuro will refuse your refund requests ingame so simply go over their heads. I would avoid providing Kuro with your account details until they provide some sort of assurance that their products will remain as advertised for longer than 1 week."
"had to rewrite my review, game is practically good, I mean the story is so compelling, and overall the game is good, except for one thing, optimization,,,the performance itself is quite lacking,even in lowest settings,my game still lags like hell, ever since 2.2 dropped, since then my phone can't handle anymore of this game, it's so laggy, it's like 1 frames per God knows how long,plss fix the optimization, so other players in low end devices can play peacefully"
love it just need to optimize
Wheres the 108 free pulls? i downloaded it but see no free pulls in mail do i need to finish quest? then its not free it was quest reward then? then it is false advertisement can i sue you?
I'm really upset that the game doesn't work with some android devices.. I played during launch but stopped because of the lag once the second update came out I wasn't able to play on my phone anymore I got this chromebook but I can't even get past the loading screen without it telling me to return to a physical device
"best improved gacha game of the year, Devs listens"
"it is okay game, biggest downside is the bad optimization on lower end phones"
"One of the best games out there, the storyline is awesome leaving you wanting for more, you can literally feel like you're playing as the main character (Rover) instead of just being a passive mc that is no better than an npc who goes around getting beaten up, and the gameplay mechanics is top tier. This is my favorite game now. I'd like to say more but I'm not really that good with english so I'll just end my review here, peace."
wasted downloading this game It always says Gateway error can't log in to the game though my Internet is ok but still don't know why this always happen when I open the app
"well it's overall good for now, well the story at first really boring but yeah I hope the story could improve more soo it's more enjoyable and impacful. that all."
"Thank you, Kuro for everything you've done to the game! You guys are the absolute best! Keep up the good work. You guys are doing amazing!"
Amazing game love it
need more character... and story's
ABSOLUTE CINEMA
"very playable and has a good story, graphics, animation etc."
"just when I thought I found a good gacha game that cares for its player base, you have to pour cold water on it with the current 2.4 patch anniversary. starting with a generous bait and now you have started showing us your true colours with this predatory 2.4 patch. there is still time you money hungry devs, get your heads back right."
ABSOLUTE CINEMA!!!
Best game ever!
"My camera becomes unstable whenever I fight the turtle weekly boss. Lock on does nothing. This issue makes the boss 2x harder to fight because I literally can't see anything (the camera would clip inside of the turtle). There's also a texture problem on Android in the Avinoleum map (for the waterways specifically). When you're riding a gondola, the waterways would literary disappear (revealing the map below), or changes to a floor-like texture, swallowing the gondola whole. Pease fix these üôè"
"If you liked Genshin, you'll love Wuwa. The company listens and prioritizes players before money though (huge difference vs Hoyo) The gameplay and mechanics are different - there's, parry, counterattack, perfect dodging...The animation and story cutscenes are SO GOOD, it doesn't feel like we're staring at game models/npcs just lip syncing and doing the same hand motion. It feels real, the characters feel alive, and THE STORY IS SO GOOD. There's also a skip button with summaries."
I feel like this game is very generous with the items and feel free to play
"Thank you kuro games for taking care of us players and for listening our suggestions and issues both. End of the day there are some toxic fans who'll give negetive review for you, but don't mind them. You're doing great and I hope we players will have great experience in the future too. Thank You again ‚ù§Ô∏è."
sold game
gooner game
shorekeeperrrrr
"Wuthering Waves is a visually stunning and ambitious game with a lot of potential, especially in its world-building and character design. The combat system feels fluid and engaging, offering a refreshing take compared to other gacha-style action RPGs. However, there are still areas that need improvement ‚Äî such as optimization, UI polish, and deeper storytelling elements to fully immerse players. With consistent updates and attention to player feedback, this game could easily become a top game"
Just awesome.....but need lil optimization im graphics
"Hi Kuro, I really liked the game but I have one big problem. I didnt online for 2 months for some reason and when I wanted to play it again I cant find my account, I checked all my gmails, facebook and kuro accounts but theres nothing. My account is gone, hopefully you can do smth abt this"
Very poggers
"best rpg so far, the only problem now is those genshin players who keeps giving low rating to our beloved wuwa. i love you wuwa, and thank you for giving me shorekeep even if i was only increasing my pity to get zani. and thank you for the anniversary gifts, we appreciate it!"
"Overall game are good, but ""anniversary"" patch feels like not anniversary patch at all, just a low usual patch. also the rewards for anniversary is quite stingy and no free 5* like ciaccona, or at least other old limited one, and the 50/50 pull for the banner is still there as well for anniversary banner, which is not good"
best graphic and lovely game not good in small device but story and character are amazing and the world is also good i love this game very much
Tolong buat translate bahasa Indonesia untuk game ini
This game is nice
game baik aku cinta kuro
Best gacha game ever.recommend the game for anyone
Greedy devs. Don't support greedy devs
Don't believe to the Leaks but believe the benefit of the doubt
"Best game, recommended"
"25/04/25 still can't play. Freeze, lag , even at lowest setting üò≠ dimensity 1080, redmi note 12 pro 5G"
this game has great potential it is better than genshin im saying this after 2 years of playing genshin good luck üíØ
"While I still play other, similar, games in the open-world Gacha space, WuWa has quickly become one of my favorite games overall. Exploration is fun, the Banner system particularly with weapons guaranteed is a massive boon to players, various update events have all been a blast, I could go on. If I could make one complaint, it would be for the lack of *viable* 4-star units. Otherwise all issues I've had personally have been addressed over time by a developer that puts the work in."
"I like the game, the amazing playstyle, and the world building, but I wish there was a character who is actually a character villain who actually hates the main character. I hate that whenever a villain is said to be like really mean, it ends up just being another person who likes or is obsessed with the main character. In other words, I want the mc to feel challenged at least once instead of being this all power full mc who defeats every boss without a sweat."
Absolute Cinema ‚úãüòØü§ö
love ur game
amazing
"It's a good game But what makes me frustrated is that it keeps crashing, I can't move through a cutscene without crashing once, and even if I don't the next cutscene is likely to crash. This game is VERY similar to genshin, but I hope it changes, i hope this issue gets solved soon, I have deleted it temporarily untill it gets solved, I only went through the gates at the first story quest and the crashes got worse. I haven't spawned into the game and I crashed."
better than genshin impact
"Everything about this game is great like story,combat,dodging except optimization. It would be great if developers focus on optimization rather than adding new maps and events. Had to lower the rating because of optimization. Not a bit of a change from before."
Literally The GOAT üóø
Comon kuro w
"Beautiful open-world RPG with engaging combat and storyline. However, lags and frame drops/stuttering can be frustrating. Despite tech issues, the game's world and characters are captivating. Hope for future performance updates!!!"
The game suddenly stops running on my phone. And it has been happening a lot lately. The game takes up a large size of storage. Please give an option for deleting previous storylines or something like that.
better than genshin
"thank you for those wonderful storyline, visual and music. truly the best game i ever play."
"Latest update became hellish, game crashes every 2 minutes"
good
"While i still *love* this game from all the way back in version 1.0, i can't ignore the preformance issues that has accumilated over the course of the recent updates that it has had. I do hope that in the upcoming anniversary can fix the rather large amount of stuttering and crashes i've had with my Android 12. I'm now almost unable to play past 1 minute without the game forcefully closing itself out... ‚Ä¢-‚Ä¢)'"
worth it yung malaking storage na sinakop sa cellphone ko ‚úåüèª‚úåüèª
it crashes on my phone when I try to login but it is a good game
it's Actually the Best gacha gameüíÖ
"too laggy when fighting big bosses non stop. I have 256gb and this game only consumes 20gb from my phone. I already delete my videos, pictures and some apps and when I fight non-stop still laggy. Hope you fix this in the upcoming update."
better than genshin
to think I'm actually revising my review for this game is not something I thought I was going to do but here we are. while their recent Livestream was decent it felt more like they're the ones celebrating and not all of us because how can you pull out a 10 rerun system with the same 50/50 system while giving an amount that's barely enough to guarantee one five star? it feels like a slap to every one who was there from day one so I'm keeping my rating low for now. hope you bounce back kuro.
The game is good but I face the lagging issue and now the game is just exiting automatically. I am not able to play. I have realme p3. I have a genshin impact that works smoothly.
"People complaining about the reviews on how there's 12 banners, my dudes you are not forced to pull for all of them and expected to get rc6 for each one. Just pick on which ever one you want."
nice game
"After loyal player base for a year, there is no choice of a highest grade unit. Unappreciated."
BEST GAME EVER. NO ONE CAN CHANGE MY MIND. KURO GAMES NEVER DISSAPPOINTS. I LOVE YOU.
"I love your game, but it still needs more optimization on mobile phone and I wish you add more features in the game that is completely unexpected and surprised the gamer's, and this game could surpass any open worlders but still second to 2nd to genshin though."
nice üôÇ
good game god tier combat
"Bad anniversary rewards. Now play Genshin and Honkai Starrail only. Better rewards for anniversary now, especially Starrail, last year give Ratio, this year give Luocha or Ruan Mei (absolute metas)"
probably the best gacha game I played. It's truly worth it seeing the game rise up to fame as I am a 1.0 player. The faith I've put here hasn't disappointed me. Not to mention how generous they are when it comes to rewards. 10/10 story 10/10 gameplay but the game can always do better. Keep up the great work Kuro!
Awesome story line gameplay. Tons of cool characters to play and rover is not usless like other games free 5 star weapon on level 45.
"I‚Äôve played Genshin Impact and Honkai Star Rail, but Wuthering Waves is the best gacha game I‚Äôve tried. The combat is smooth and fun, and the world feels alive. What really blew me away is the 2.2 story it‚Äôs emotional, well-written, and super engaging. I didn‚Äôt expect to get this hooked, but now I can‚Äôt stop playing. If you enjoy gacha games with great gameplay and story, definitely give this one a shot. Edit:-After 2.2, the game lagging too much only in Raguna region in Poco F6 with good specs"
the most generous f2p ever!!!
I hope the story improves. I feel like every character introduced automatically admires or is so affectionate to rover. This makes the story bland and predictable to me. Bad fanservice there Kuro.
"no drama, if you enjoy the game just play it, hater gonna hate."
the animations are really eye catching
"after playing so much genshin, it really feels like a reliever"
please make it to xbox
great
fix your optimization
"The game is good but we need another optimization patch as quick as possible please and also can you make the mobile version as clear as pc ver, not the graphics i meant the visual clarity, why is it kinda blurry pls fix this i love this game"
Arabic language not included
"this game is awesome. The graphics, the storyline, and even the characters. Also the developers are very generous unlike other games."
"You deserve 5 Star. You've been generous even before the anniversary. By the way, I love the Changli Costume."
now after the apology we have an anniversary with around 50 pulls 2.4 is also a major patch right after anniversary.
Really funn
"easy 5 star!! I've been playing this masterpiece since release but it's my first rating for the game. This is the only Gacha developer who listens even thou a lot of players is abusing their kindness but they kept what they've started. I can't believe that a lot of people just can't appreciate how the game progress and the effort of the team it's a big ""W"" for Kuro games really deserves it, I'm not a glazer of this game I just appreciate how it exist. Please Kuro games team keep existing"
ts goon bait working
"I will always support you, Kuro. Feel sad for the negative feedback which is not even your false but their misunderstanding and bottomless hunger. from SEA player (Thailand)"
"I love Wuthering Waves but it crashes so much, I recently got a brand new phone but the game barely runs. I'll log in then it will crash a minute later. I can't even open the menu without it crashing and I have it on the lowest graphics!!! Hopefully this will be fixed in the future."
Nice I Like It Like Story Anime Hope Many Missions like anime
Peak absolute peak
I just love the game and am enjoying it I don't really care about rewards and other stuff keep up the good work wuwa devs you guys are already doing good don't worry about negative reviews and just a little request I would love to see Rover's new attires.
Thanks for anniversary gifts kuro...
not giving a free limited five star character on anniversary is way too greedy .. wuwa become a another genshin
very good üëç thanks üôè
Best gacha game I have ever played.
"kuro, please do optimize your data performance, my internet is at least always in 900kb or 1mb per second. I hope you fix this, it's getting inconvenient."
Please fix the update size
"thi was awesome game ever I played, it gacha system tooo good"
this game is so good but i hate the fanservice in this game
I love this game and the developers generosity!
I love this game. Character kits have some depth to them which I enjoy thoroughly. The story is pretty good if you care to listen to it (particularly Jinhsi's/Jue's). Plenty of combat events that give a really good amount of currency towards pulls. There are some more laid back events as well if that is more your taste.
I'm excited for 2.4 area and cyberpunk Collab
stuff
Came back after watching the anniversary stream. Loved to see the devs approach on the anniversary. Totally in for the celebration. I hope devs always continue to love the game and continue making improvements. I liked the celebratory mood rather than the usual gacha games money making approach. I think new features will really feel rewarding. I don't care much about rewards because devs really make us feel that we are celebrating the anniversary. I hope that you continue like this.
"the echo sistem needs a rework, whoever come up with the idea of tuning, it's really horrible, unenjoyable, unpleasant. thank you for destroying your own work."
Thanks kuro games for your rewards
noice
"low reward anniversry, your 20x free pull enough to get lingyang üò°. should have free 5 limit reso or a guereentee banner."
Fix the god damn ping bro. After the latest patch its always reconnecting. My internet is not even slow. Thanks.
It's an amazing game I have played it for a long time the combat is great. the animation the story the characters design the voice line is outstanding ü§©
so cool
nice game
love this game. best f2p gatcha game there has ever been in history
DON'T ENTER THE GAME I MY PHONE DEVICE
üëç
"Best Gacha Game ever! Love you Kuro, Keep it upüî•"
"I have a conplain, idk why the server ping is very High. I have a very stable internet connection but sometimes when I play wuwa it's shows 999 ping and I can't play the game. its very irritating pls fix it. I use sea server from India."
"great game, low pity and guaranteed weapon is very generous, plus I still able to finish the content by only pulling characters I like"
"it's a great game, but the community is greedy. The compensation rewards are awesome but they are not contented."
heck yeah‚ÄºÔ∏èüó£Ô∏è
Juat insane
nice
"I'm back here to support wuwa again, people are absolutely greedy and mad for the anniversary but in my opinion it's very generous of you all devs. here's a 5star review! Vamos üíô"
Try and you'll see why it's 5 star üôÇ
The best game open world with cool animation.. and also lots of waifu
good game thats all to say
my favorite game!!
The best game open world
Can't play Version 1.1 ..It has some issues on mobile phone...Need Mobile optimization asap! update : Shifted to PC and it is really amazing and the devs are so much better than other gacha devs..2.2 was amazing
dumb game
I enjoyed the game so much. Resources are abundant and exploration is fun and fast paced. The developers are also generous and listen to their players.
best Gacha game for my first gacha game ye
absolute cinema ‚úãÔ∏èüò≥ü§ö
one of the best game I played ‚ù£Ô∏è
Great game!
love this game
keep barking lmao
"i love the game, lots of resources to grind (asterite) and challenging. this game I thought at first is just a generic 2D game but it makes me play since release til now without knowing it's the anniversary already. keep up the good work and ignore the toxic players. what matters are those people you make happy, not those who complain."
best
the game has improved over time but this game seriously needs more optimization
great game
Great game üëç
great game
Peak
best game
Game is great. It's a shame the ¬£5 discount for 250 play points is not available anymore.
"generous, game mechanics are not boring, adventure is much more fun (than genshin ü§™)"
I hope kuro make echoes that apply Attribute Debuffs like Spectro Frazzle
keep on the good work you are doing great but can you please bring the flight mechanism to other regions
absolutely cinema
Absolutely loves the game and will always continue to play it. You may add some ads with a little gift like astrite or exp. But make sure it is not auto ads cuz we really dislike that thing
good game
I was doing Jinzhou rising black shores l - act Vlll but then the portal wasn't appearing
This game is peak üî• Must try cuz it has a good community and generous and kind developers.
G kikir üòÅ
"fun, no ads, takes forever to load at first but after the game runs very smoothly"
"No words needed. A great, wholesome game!"
"Not really a fan of the art style, overall this game is amazing, If u prefer games like genshin impact and any other adventure type game this is fun!"
"I love the game, but the community? they don't deserve the anniversary rewards at all, it's like biting the hand of the ones feeding you"
Bruh yang minta buat bahasa Indonesia dan Malaysia tu pergilah belajar bahasa Inggeris susah sangat ke nak belajar dan faham inggeris? Yang tak tahu bahasa inggeris tu Pergi sekolah balik
I just gonna give it a 5 star because kuro games deserve it
"U dont need to apologize about anything! Happy 1st anniversary! Just concern about ur quality. Please, deliver ur game until the story end. Dont spoil the players! let the difficult content be difficult and dont give more rewards more than ur profit. Invest ur profit for the game content! Thanks for ur hard work since 1.0-2.2!"
"very good devs that respects the players. still a gacha game so you will do some light farming and grinding during end game, though not very time consuming."
I like the game for its graphics and gameplay it is so satisfying to play‚ù§Ô∏è
I'll really enjoyed this game
The best gacha game becave the Dev's team listen to our concern and provide solutions faster.
"More difficult opponents like The Lifer would be nice, maybe reward for beating them weekly..."
Thanks Kuro and thanks developers
I love this game Soo much
the best game ever for me
"overall, the game is good, with decent quality outstanding gameplay. The only problem for me about this game is that I got lag and ping jumping (i play other game with higher quality with strong internet connection) even if i play it with low graphics at my 8gb ram rtx 4050 laptop (acer predator helios neo 16)"
best game ever üí™
Update 2.0+ : Enjoying this new region. A lot of QoLs update + this would be 3A games if it werent for Gacha Mechanics. But overall really satisfied with the game quality
"bad anniversary rewards, devs don't care anymore"
nice game
this is yet the best open world game I've ever had imagine the graphics gameplay stories are a chef's kiss!!
It is a very player friendly game The best dev's I have ever seen i love this game and the devs always listen to players'feedback and make it possible as they can. thank you kuro gamesü•∞ü´°ü´∞
"Wonderful Gacha games, truly set a new standard of how good the quality provided for a free open world gacha. I hope for the game to continue to strive for the better!"
For now it seems pretty good
good
"I see a lot of people are flaming Kuro for not being generous with Aniversary rewards, which is understandable and I agree 100% banner is needed. However, for a mobile game it is still decent. If you want a bad example of mobile game with crazy greed, it would be Raid Shadow legends. PTW and they would nerf characters after patches so all that money spent was for naught."
"The game mechanics and the story was great. The updates are also improving with new qol. In the future patch Please make a male Sentinels resonator that can transform into a knight with robotic armor like the one from (Swallow star) anime, and a giant enemy monsters (Godzilla-like)..thanks."
Love the MC
"I really like it. The rewards are too good, but some of the other players are greedy because of it and putting bad ratings. The combat is smooth and fun, too. The characters' designs are also chefs kiss."
best game
beautiful graphics & smooth gameplay üòçüòçüòç
Definitely better than Genshin or any hoyogames ü§£
"it's a good game i played in release i didn't like the gameplay back then, but started playing again and i enjoyed it deserve 5 star"
love kuro games!! I'm so sorry for the retards review bombing!!
"gak bisa berkata-kata, inj game bagus gila, gw Ampe nangis main ni game karna game sebagus ini rusak gara gara device gw gk kuat, kpn yah bisa min grafik high di g99üò≠"
I love the gameplay and the environment of the game. The only problem is the ping and lag. I would like to see reruns of events for those who are new to the game or for the casual players. Like the Zani event or the Xiangli Yao event back in 1.2 or something similar. That would be nice.
Hello! Greetings to Kuro Games. I would like to thank you for creating Wuthering Waves and let me experience different kinds of adventures. I like to know more about the Sentinels because they are interesting. And please add more mechanics about parrying and dodging enemy attacks as well as some unique sounds during parry and dodge like we can actually feel the weight of the attack by just hearing the attack or dodge sounds. Or if possible can we create a base or buy a house in every region? Ty
I really love this game but please add arabic language please <3
nice game. let's recommended this game to other so this game could compete with genshtrash
good üòä

worst anniversary rewards wheres the free 5 star character. cheap game
brl they deserve this and i will say it the dev's are way better than genshin impact they actually listen and work on what we say and the free rewards are on top üëçüëç
good game
"As a newcomer in this type of games, I found this game absolutely incredible.. 4 stars because I think we have very limited options to interact with main characters outside quests. I hope that in coming updates the game adds new features including common world maps and more."
"Absolutely love the game. The game just keeps getting better. That being said. I absolutely, positively , and resolutely hate, hate, hate and hate......time limits. grrrrrrrrrrr. If I wanna take my level 1 character with their level 1 weapons and spend 5 days beating on a boss i should absolutely be able to. I'm sick of wasting my time due to your time limits. fire whoever it is that works there that thinks time limits are fun. lol. Time limits throw out the skill part of the game"

"Its so beautiful, the combat and movements are satisfying. And the pokemon system is good"
"the anniversary rewards are so so disappointing, it doesn't feel like an anniversary at all but like a filler patch, Solon this is not very player friendly>:("
actually listens to the players and amazing lore
"It's a good open world exploration game with an engaging story and a challenging but fair endgame. All in all, more enjoyable than Genshin, with very thoughtful map design, exploration streamlining, and of course fairer content for casual players. Took out three stars for the censorship issue because it's really upsetting to see the devs make changes to characters some players paid for. Otherwise, the game is a solid 9/10 apart from a few minor QoL hindrances. PS: disappointing anniversary"
"keep up the good work going kuro, o7 a huge salutation to all of your efforts."
It's a AAA Gacha game.
Game is very good I really I love playing it and animations and art style is stunning but it needs more optimization I think may be devoloper make it more optimised
I'm in love
"Happy 1st Anniversary, there a lot of noise, but let's have a great Anniversary."
Play for yourself and you'll know. or you might have a different opinion than me.
BEST GACHA GAME thank you kuro games
I love this gane but will look closely what will unfold in the future considering the fiasco that is the first anniversary.
Better than GI worst anniversary event than GI too so get it together kuro
milking female characters left and right then giving them half naked cloths to sell is something other than that it's okay if you want to play just for female characters.
love
"Anniversaries are supposed to be the time when developers show their appreciation to players for supporting their game. Kuro decided that creating 2 anniversary banners of 12 characters with STANDARD 50/50 mechanics and 30 immediately usable limited pulls (farming events and exploring a map is patch content not anniversary rewards) was more than enough to reward us. I should have expected that in the end every million dollar company is cut from the same cloth, with the exact same goal: Money!"
"Amazing game, I would say it's an improved version of genshin. The combat mechanics are far better. Button mashing like in genshin does not work here. You need to actually pay attention to the enemy and dodge and parry. That alone makes every fight more interesting. Unlike genshin where the fights become repetitive after a while."
"just love this game, anyone wants to play open world game try this wuwa‚ô•Ô∏èplus you have skip options üòò"
best game
"The improvements to optimization and the multiplayer experience has been really solid so far, but with the recent announced changes for the anniversary patch, 2.3, it feels as though Kuro games are undervaluing long-term players and putting up very exploitative banners while giving little in the way of rewards for an anniversary. As a player since day 1, I feel I should get the priority, not new players who came in late. Also, ignore people complaining about fanservice and male characters."
bruh I lost everything after I redownload the game just because I needed STORAGE!
"the best game I ever played, the dev really puts all their hard work into the game and generous too not to mention they listen to the community and fix it's problem, thank you kuro games"
"This game is amazing and also the developer really put their love and heart to the game and all their players. Good quality of relationship, they always listen to us"
best game ever
"I Like Wuthering Waves You Can't Complain It Since It Is Quite New But Still Very Good Combat System And Best Character Designs, Definitely A Good Game"
Mejorar rendimiento para Mobil aunque a lo mejor tenga que comprarme uno nuevo ya
best game ever!
Optimization for mobile users needed!
"One of the best gacha released.Good combat,good story,good exploration and good devs who listens to their players.Worth playing."
"The game is so good in every aspect, yes I dont have a good gaming phone im playing it at 30 fps ,yes it lags sometimes but it didn't bother me at all the stories are great.Not gonna complain about the current ""issue"" because I'm just a F2P player.Others might be lost on how these kinds of games really work but yeah I can't blame them. And also this game is created by the devs to support their family, I mean business is business right? Above all I'm very happy to experience how good this game is"
Very F2P friendly!!
"Can't play on my low end phone sadly but does run smoothly on my laptop. So far the game is cookin. Great character designs, so far diving into the lore, overall great game!"
Very good and Excellent Gameplay
I don't care about the drama I'm enjoying the game and fair rewards
"I've been a player since 1.0(& beta), the game's improvement is amazing,the graphics, the GamePlay, the Aesthetic, but WHY IS IT THE NEWLY RELEASED ARE MOSTLY FEMALE,The only male this version(2.0)has been released is ONE which is Brant. Add MORE MALE CHARACTERS & skin or Better yet RELEASED SCAR! Edit:When I saw the 1st Anniversary ""Rewards"" I'm super DISAPPOINTED, I thought it's player 'friendly', when this game first released kuro literally give MORE wishes both the standard, limited banners."
Great game
"PEAK GAMEPLAY Disregard the beggars, they don't do shi"
To whoever who is disappointed about the anniversary reward. To be honest i am dissappointed by the reward they initially presented but they have apologized and please remember they have been constantly trying to improve the game working hard for 8 month and in this anniversary they have a lot of great qol. I don't meam to do attack on hoto game but let me remind you guys a lot of hoyo games have almost no improvement. People can make mistake but that doesn't mean 1 mistake make them a sinner.
its just good But Some Beggar Want More Rewards Ahh Greedy Just Spending 300 per month ??
a great game but right now is getting little greedy and also high end fights have lags & bad anniversary gifts. Positives like good mechanics is a thing but they have to do better optimisation of the game.
"Please give better anniversary rewards, which is 140 pulls + 1 (5 star) then I'll change the review."
"A bit too laggy, whether it be in the overworld or in domains. Hopefully more optimization is coming"
"I know that many are upset that the anniversary event lacks a free 5-star character, its understandable; however, this isn't the game's final anniversary or something, and overreacting is unwarranted. Unfortunately, this negativity has given other communities reasons to further criticize and trash our own."
"Stunning open world, love the grinding, character design goes crazy, love the unhinged people, the movement is sooo nice and the combat makes you use your brain. I appreciate the devs open communication and willingness to correct the rare misjudgements!"
good aniversary unlike all genshin aniversary
Very fun and entertaining with many different ways to play.
OH HELL NAWH THIS GAME IS THE BEST I'VE PLAYED
best gameüéÆüéÆ‚ò∫‚ò∫
"Don't be fooled by these troll reviews of the others. I have been playing this game since it launched and it is beautiful, the graphics, gameplay, characters, story, etc are absolutely amazing. Definitely one of the best free games that you can play in this time."
"Meager rewards, predatory practices, FOMO and endless grinding. This game does not respect your time as a player and tries to get away with doing the bare minimum improvements necessary. You can get some enjoyment out of it in the beginning, but after a while it devolves into 5 minutes of dailies (chores) every day while you wait for something to change. Everything about this game is engineered not to provide a satisfactory gaming experience but to make you spend more money on it."
best gacha game imo
the best game is absolutely worth it keep it up kuro. this game deserves 10 stars tbh
Bad anniversary awards
ABSOLUTE PEAK GAMEPLAY!
love to play this game the combat the story every things is perfect but losing 5050 on the character you want it sucks specially when it's happens in a row like bro seriously. like farming the currency for straight 4 to 5 hours and then lose the on a character you don't want. REMOVE IT or increase the rate to 75/45
"Pretty great for a free to play game although it does require a bit of a higher specs mobile to have smooth game play. But other than that requirement. The gameplay, character and combat animations and exploration have pretty high rating for me."
This is so player friendly üò©
"It's actually a good game, I recommend it if you like gacha games that are open world. I also like the character designs in the game very pretty and I appreciate the attention to detail with the Npc's of this game. Additional to the amount of rewards the game gives you, it's very amazing. It's good if you're a f2p player since you don't have to spend that much on the game and the apocalyptic theme of the game is also quite interesting tho there are sometimes bugs to the game but overall a 8/10."
"amazing graphics, gameplay, characters and story. Devs actually listen to their fans and constantly trying to make the game more better for us."
"Great game, no leo lloros"
"Amazing game, and I appreciate the devs unlike CN players. I believe they have better plans for the future."
"please don't change wuthering waves, you're the best game I've played so far... *cries*"
"Please make useless echo to become material for upgrade another echo, for now we all restricted to upgrading echo bcs need use energy and time, please kurochan"
its a good game
"One of the best gacha game with beautiful character, cool art and amazing storyline. Eventhough many people give a bad reviews bcs of the anniversary rewards, i know u already do ur best to please your Rover. I hope u will always keep improving so we can enjoy more to play ur games"
"it's amazing how the main character kills such boss even with memory loss and people the river doesn't know or familiar with, she still insists on helping them no matter the cost. it's cool!"
love this game so much!
I LOVE THIS GAME SO GOOD
This game is fantastico!!
"giving 5 stars cause for me I'm already content on what the developers are doing like improving the game, giving astrites as free for fixing things, and most of all they will hear your complains regarding the game"
nah...iam not here for Anni Reward...i jus want my Waifu :>
i always lose üíîüíîüíî
good open world game best developer
the game is best i ever played there's only one problem that is ping.... I felt that my internet is too slow but I'm playing on 5g ....
"Best game ever!!!(Genshin could never) man I feel bad for kuro, beggars keep begging..."
Best Experience. I love this game more than every game exist. Please create more something new. Don't mind those beggars they're not ur customers. W Kuro
"Everything is nice but the one thing that bothers me are how the animations stop suddenly, like it just looks stiff. Maybe adding an animation to transition one to another would make it more fluid?? (im trying to sound english here dm if my grammar sucks...!!) Overall, great game!!"
"I find it better on PC with the quality of graphics, but since the story they have come up with is better than any AAA title I ever played, I thought I'd just give it a 5 stars here ! Kuro has surpass any expectations I had for this game in every department. Graphic, Story, Music, Character, Combat. Amazing game!"
Don't believe the people who rated this game 1 star. Those are Hoyoshills astroturfing. First anniversary rewards are pretty good. Ignore the Hoyotards 1 star review.
"Totally unplayable, both PC and mobile optimization is trash even the lowest graphics it lags so much it's impossible to dodge."
"- flight is restricted in one region, What's the point of adding flight if u can't fly anywhere u want? - Chain Ultimate skill animation is locked behind a dumb event. make it available available everywhere to make combat more immersive. - 1st anniversary rewards are disappointing - Lower boss hp and increase their damage instead in tower event, to make it harder not annoying when u don't have a V6 character that can deal alot of damage. make it more about dodging rather than damage check."
"I lost my 50/50 to jianxin(i got her at 80th pity), but in my 160th that's just when I got shorekeeper. This is a gacha game so that's expected, although they are very generous with astrites(currency for pulling resonators/characters). You really have to invest some time in order to get what you want in this game, and the mechanics of the game actually help you as well. The beginner resonators are already good enough to gain progress within the game. Hopefully, this game will continue to grow."
üëçüèª
Love this Game but the Community or Fan Base of this Game is Garbage...They're getting what they request yet people Greediness never change as what it was supposed to be...The more they Receive the more they wan't...I feel bad for Kuro trying they're best to be able keep up the feedback yet some of the community wasn't satisfied of the reward...They should make they're own Game if they we're like that...Idiotism or Stupidity doesn't clarify of what they we're. The Drop of Rating is make me mad
"this great game, f2p friendly. don't read the rate of the beggars that can't be content on the rewards and free stuff that the game/dev gave to them. Feel free to see their toxicity on Fb group so you'll be able to understand"
nice game bro would rate again
i forever support this game.
The game is great. They listen to the player's feedback. I have suggested things since 1.0 to them and they delivered.
"Peak gameplay, peak story, peak characters and peak anniversary rewards."
"A very wonderful game with amazing storylines and qualities. I don't know why some players are being ungrateful but as a player since the beginning of this game, i love it and i am grateful for playing this for the first time last year and now I'm back from college work. The characters designs and the other beautiful things that this game has are absolutely gorgeous. The first rewards made me happy even until now as a F2P player is very refreshing to me as an old genshin player."
the game has improved a lot
üòå
5 star just make up for those who rated low hehe but this game deserve 5 star fr
this game is way better than genshin impact in every way plus don't listen to those beggars and hoyoslave they don't matter
"very good game, and rlly listens to their player base however I would appreciate more variety in characters specifically male chars or possibly non human chars which would be quite fun :>"
the hate is so unnecessary üíÄüôè
great gameplay! thank you devs.
"I'm actually have a very high expectations when it comes from kuro company...just like pgr, that game was a huge impact imo...now this game released and I'm not disappointed at all...smooth gameplay(maybe between 50-60fps).that i have no lagging issues anymore, stunning graphics of course, lots of quest and missions,and the way the implement the story through the game cutscenes...this game have a very huge potential..üëç ps:your anniversary rewards is good already just ,ignore those beggars."
"Revert Cantarella's model changes back, or give me compensation of atleast 10 pulls. I didn't waste 130 pulls only to get scammed. I can't spend knowing I can't trust y'all because of changes like these after I pulled the character. The censorship sucks as well. I hate it. I'm not spending in this game anymore."
absolutely loving this game. enjoying overall everything but there's one particular problem I'm having after 2.2 update. the sentry construct echo I use always slides off the enemies and does no damage. no matter how far or close I attack from it always slides off
"I love the game , bottled anniversary reward"
"Good experience so far. It does need a bit of optimization but overall, it is a nice game. characters are good, combat is smooth and graphics is perfect. solid game ."
"THE BEST GAME EVER! I don't usually play gacha games, but their story quest and open world are absolutely beautiful and work of arts. All the characters have unique abilities and backgrounds which keep you interested into playing more, and it's F2P friendly."
Graphics quality is low and intro is kind of boring 1/10
"I really like the game, fighting style ,story, monster and farming system for all good but I want dev keep improve the game about lagging and graphic I don't want this game dead quickly so I hope dev take a noted. I will give full star if this game keep improving more and more . Best Game"
Your great kuro games. dont mind the bombing of negative 1star review. Keep up the good work. thanks for keeping the game great
i love the game but the Anniversary awards rlly dissapointed me
too many female characters:'(
I love this game and I can play smoothly but in Cantarella story quest game show like lag and crush. is this a bug please fix this.
I love this game
"Amazing game. I'm surprised thisnis even free. Great story telling less 1.0, outstanding visuals and SFX. Truely one of a kind game. Storngly recommend all of you to give it a try"
"Amazing, fun and engaging combat animations and really beautiful scenery, the reason I'm rating this a 1 star is because of how high the specs requirements are...you need a 12GB RAM phone in minimum to even run the game properly, my current phone (One Plus 7T) cannot run WuWa almost at all because of the extreme overheating it's like this game might just explode my phone, while it can run other big games like Genshin impact and Honkai: Star rail perfectly fine with 0 lagging and overheating."
"Hey Kuro! just wanna say that the freaking performance of the game is back to the previous version that had passed. Too much fps drop and glitches, even if I switch to the lowest graphics as possible, It doesn't make any difference. Right now I'm not in the mood to play this game!"
Nice
"wanted to start with some cons. This game is too heavy to be a mobile game, it really requires a high end mobile device to actually play this smoothly, the lagginess is too unbearable as it hindered a great gameplay experience (and so i moved to pc). That said, great graphics and mechanics, really different from others and unique, but also very detailed, it's so eye catching although not an eye candy type. Overall amazing game, but needs far adjustment for the mobile experience to be playable."
The worst anniversary.
it's fun but disappointed me for not giving enough anniversary reword
I really like this game .why some people attack this game. please don't attack this game. Don't hurt the people who love Wuthering Wave üôè
visuals are great currently moving on the story line
love it
"as long as you can sit through first few chapter, greatness awaits üíØ"
No cap. This game the best
Most wonderful game of my life. this game is part of me yoooüíú
Thank you to kuro and the dev team. I'm sorry for those beggar players who didn't appreciate the anniversary rewards. Hope you guys are taking it easy and don't listen to those who want more and more rewards. Happy 1st anniversary!
Perfect Game for me
bad anniversary reward
it's a great game running well on my poco x6 Pro
it's a pretty nice game . keep it up devs
"Updated: I'm still playing since day 1. And stull experiencing constant ping spikes and lags. My wifi and connection is strong. It has 4/5 bars at all times. As well as my provider has great connectivity. How come the game ping spikes to 200ms using SnapD 850? 2.0 is great and all. But OPTIMIZE THE DAMN GAME, Kuro."
so üÜí
"very good love it,"
Great Game but as a mobile player I can't enjoy the view ( graphics) without compromising the connectivity hopefully in the future they will have a tech break through and come up with a PVP team or solo feature in the game
Didn't like the story at all so deleted
keep it up devs keep cooking‚ú®
"I installed the game, it was 19 gigs. Took an hour for the shader thing to finish. I play it for a few minutes, it looked decent. I tried playing the game again, it needs a 17 gig update. I downloaded that, it wants to do the shader compile thing again. I might try to play the game once more but it just feels silly having to download so much and wait so long to be able to play. Im skeptical, it feels like they are just trying to make a sale by having it appear to be more than it is."
"I like the gameplay and content more than the rewards. many players have been greedy nowadays. after the anniversary, I never complained about it and just enjoy the game. nothing else. my phone is Infinix Zero 30 5G, and it plays very well with a slight lag(but not really due to almost full storage). Even though it's heating up, it wasn't lagging at all."
This game is fire
Hi Im Khyver I would like to give a message to kuro games. Kuro You have been Great and generous to us players Dont get offended by those Ungrateful players who want more pulls You have given us enough and im very thankful for that kuro you have made the game that changed my life thank you I hope you done more good things in the future thank you
game is good but i m not happy with the female characters because they are more hotter then me and my bf plays this game so i feel jealous thats why i don't like this game don't make the female revealing
I'm giving 5 star because kuro deserve it. kuro don't listen to greedy individual on the anniversary rewards. the generosity you showed all this year is already wayy to much then a so called gacha game called genshin. You guys rock it. Be yourself and bring the creative things you guys bring always. thank you guys for hearing us. but I'd say anniversary is kinda cheap from the patch apologies we got from you guys as a day 1 player. but hey I'm not complaining.
Best Gacha game better than GI
have fun with greed
"People do be hitting that 1 star because of the so called ""worse"" anniversary rewards, like dude, even if you are a day 1 player or not, kuro is still generous with you and it's not their fault that you're having a ""you"" problems with the rewards. Other than that, if you still insist on wanting kuro to up their rewards, i think it's time for you to go to other games my guy or look at yourself into the mirror and think what you can do when you're in the position of this situation."
Anniversary is does not feel anniversary at all
"Been playing since release but i had my fair share of not playing the game for a few weeks and months but overall the game us great and a fun, my only issue is that the more the game updates the more connection problem. The game used to have 1-90ms which is considered as Green ping but lately after Black shores were added the game always stayed at 100-200ms which is the Yellow ping, it's annoying to fight a enemy especially when the ping drops during a attempt."
"Kuro is generous right from the start. Every patch the event rewards are decent. Free astrites, pulls & many more. I dunno why people are too greedy and requesting for everything to be free. This game is beautiful & amazing."
Bestho
rating 5star just to make the anniversary downraters cry moreü•±
goood game
sadly the rewards decline from patch to patch.
Love the game and rewards keep it up
"Fantastic game. Action packed, breathtaking visuals and amazing landscapes to explore. played this game since day 1 and a shame I wasn't able to extend that via beta test plays. Currently satisfied with everything this game offers. Except that it's starting to get kinda heavy with system requirements."
giving 5 stars cause dev always listened to players and improved the game alot since 1.0 up till now and I'm a free to play and your game is too generous for those who just beg and can't even do endgame content thank you for giving us a good experience for a year
"great game, disgusting greedy fandom. in 11 months i never enjoyed a game this much. it was so giving and caring for its players, so only real players know how the devs love their game and their rovers. the ones causing the chaos are just some kids with no sense of enjoying the game and be thankful. great work kuro, please keep up!"
very good and very generous with the rewards.
im sorry kuro you have to go through all of those complaints. The anniversary rewards are actually amazing! Much better than any other games I play. love ya devs
"Amazing story, maps, characters, have so much meaningful scenery and to add, I hope theres more of those x2 drops for materials when grinding for mats, its very helpful :D"
No matter what will play wuthering waves.
love this game so muchü§ç it's okay kuro i always support yallü§ç you guys pls be grateful and thankful to kuro ....they already did their best ..
"No matter what they tell you, I'm still here to support you, no matter how small or big the rewards you give me, I will accept them wholeheartedly"
"best I have ever played, with dodge and parry system and not to mention flying! flying in the game is so satisfying, exploring the map is more fun. just me but playing the game give me a sense of achievement whenever I manage to clear end game content where other game is more like a chores"
great
personally......I LOVE wuthering waves.Their dev team is sooo professional and listen to the players!!!! The character designs r stunning üåü I love da characterz and I am a player from 1.0 I am tooo involved in this game to turn back now this game has taught me go enjoy the little things in life n appreciate the ppl around me...... keep up the good work!!!!!!!!! ‚ù§Ô∏è ‚ù§Ô∏è ‚ù§Ô∏è
"literally the best gacha company ever, thank you kuro games don't mind the greedy fake fans u can't get satisfied no matter what u do. don't forget to take a rest i love you guys!"
"this game is a complete package to a f2p, dont listen to those people who rate it a 1 ‚≠ê"
"I still support this game no matter what. There are just Players so ungrateful with the efforts of the developers and still give good rewards. They are just disappointed because there's no free 5* resonators in 1st anniversary. I don't mind it. Every rewards I got from the game, I'm still blessed."
"very good optimization since 1.0 i dont care on the rewards, i just need more QoL like using wings in all regions"
Ita funny this time devs are listening to the players and other gacha players hate this game out of joulesy ha you guys wish
Best Gacha game
BESTTT
Regarding the underwhelming and disappointment of the 1st year Anniversary of Wuthering Waves. The Rewards for the anniversary is unferwhelming and disrespectful towards to players that play your game since the beggining. Please be more rewarding and thoughtful in the future.
Thank for the wonderful year of experience Kuro. We had a blast and we had full of excitement every time new version comes. May you continue doing it don't mind the bashers. Happy 1st Anniversary!
absolute cinemaü§öüòê‚úã
Ignore those greedy players! We already appreciate your rewards already!
"Don't let the 1* review bomb distract you from the fact that the game is absolutely amazing, from the story, characters, music and gameplay. Thank you to the devs for all the hard work, and I wish you all the best."
"Really great game tbh, specifically the combat system and the fact that 4 star characters are designed to work well with 5 star characters, the MC is also really well made and not useless compared to other gacha games. One thing you guys might need to improve is the performance you get playing the game on a middle end phone and below, everything else is just chef's kiss."
Thank you kuro games for what you have done other people only want every for free but you already have given enough go at your own pace and bring more good things in future üëç
best anniversary ‚ù§Ô∏è
"Great game, I love it! why r people so angry with thr anniv rewards... its good... thats what yall get for believing fake leaks"
Looking forward to Cyberpunk Collab
"Beautiful, may be laggy but is still playable. One of the best games or maybe even the best ones I've ever tried"
"Great game, generous rewards and excellent developers. Don't mind negative ratings. They're just those players from THAT game and trying to drag WUWA down."
"I had high hopes for this game. And I genuinely believe it's a bit better than genshin. But lately, it seems Kuro games have been taking notes from Hoyoverse. I'll admit, I'm not pleased with the anniversary awards. And what is it with the lack of not only four star characters but also male characters? The last guy we had was Brant, and even then, the hype for him has died off. Any hopes I had for this game are flying out the window if something doesn't change for the better."
"I love this game. It's amazing actually. The combat, story, and music, is all top notch. The world building is sublime. So why 1 star? Their recent anniversary stream shows exceptional predatory behavior, an underwhelming and disappointing update and rewards, stupid cubes, and that the devs are generally out of touch with the community. Offering free limited 5* with 1.2 but anniversary 2.3 just has rerun banners with the same pity system and 50/50 as normal. Like, thanks kuro?"
This game is fun to play and I love the mechanics on this game like how all the characters are able to run up the wall and evade the obstacle while doing so. All the characters in the game is just eye-catching. I also love how the combat system works in this game. This game also generous for giving me free 2 5-star characters at the beginning of the game. Thanks for free 5 stars. Cheers
"I love the graphics, it doesn't load in a very slow and painful way and the developers are very generous. However, some designs are pretty much too jiggly? but I don't pay much attention to that although the people that are complaining are. the open world adventures are very very fun but the developers should listen to the players complaining about the extra physics in the game. nonetheless, very nice game, I love it."
it's a very good game I've played since it was released but there is one issue and that is storage optimization of storage is a must dear game developer please do something regarding storage because of this i deleted the game after it's fixed I will install it back thanks.
such a good game
Keep up the good work
"I really love the game!! the accent of every character is so unique, i dont have any problem with the storage even though im playing in mobile but the graphics was the issue well i mean it's ok though but the thing is every time i do combats it suddenly lags and sometimes it freezes."
Best game
"Game is great, love the characters and story, but every time I click to resonate/wish or click any button that brings me to an info page, game immediately crashes, game is also very buggy in general. I play on mobile with lowest settings and have a decent phone, is there any fixes or upcoming updates to fix this?"
"I found bug of Internet when try log-in to enter gameplay by tap on hill two characters wait if login character drab you or looking. Error Pop-up Bad Gateway Internet. I have Good Wi-Fi, Fully Load, In-game bad beep sound too. No I cannot enter gameplay due.. Performe Issue very much... When Encountering Enemies may sometimes lag sike I try spam rolling and dodging, When Heavy Attack I try spam screen Attack Button frame drop, Later I been hit due MetaTek as unplayable explm: V62 MetaTek"
"One of my favorite gacha games so far. High quality graphics, awesome gameplay, engaging plot and very accomodating developers. Keep up the good work! Thank you Kurogames! I'm also hoping that someday raytracing will be available for AMD graphics cards. üòä"
you know my weakness is you
One of the best gacha games ever and has the best dev team I've experienced/seen.
One of the best gacha games I played
I played wuwa since release and quit after changli banner and came back for phoebe and I gotta say the changes since the beginning to now is huge and I liked that the developers are listening well to the community. Really looking forward to the future with the games progression and will support kuro just like how they supported us as players.
Can this game come onto the Nintendo Switch or Switch 2?
Best game ever
approved
I just love the gameplay and the mechanics. please keep up the good work dev!!! we love you!!
I only need 4 letters to describe this game. This is straight up PEAK.
"Great game, amazing grafic fps , and personally I love the character design and art style. Overall , good job üëç"
The game is generous enough to be able to get characters with each update. There's lag and black screens but the overall experience and game play is fun and really enjoyable ^-^
This Game is Epic Great Open World And Cool Characters !!!
censored. Tone deaf devs. A worse genshin.
"Great game, improves each update, amazing character designs, they never fail to deliver absolute peak. We need a bit more male characters though, and hopefully the review bombs stop soon."
"Great combat gameplay, great graphics and storytelling. Better to play this on PC though."
Very great game. Good Story Good Arts Good Music Good Character design Good Rewards All superb
Absolut karbiter ‚úãüòåü§ö
great gameplay great story great music great reward for sure 5 star(bet some think this is bot review)
Gooooodddd
"Changed my ratings after the recent 1st anniversary stream, it's killing the old players and only benefitting newer players. Did you forgot who stays by your side on your darkest time (beta-1.0) and simply forgot about the old player by making the player-friendly system/rewards exclusively newer player?"
This is an epic game. I love it!
very Much enjoyed the game keep it up kuro üëçüèª
trash game
"The game has ultimate potential on topping most anime style games in yhe industry. However, several issues that disrupts the gaming quality of users that play on mobile makes it difficult for players to accommodate the lags. Once this issue is resolved, I'd be more than willing to give this a 5 star. Thank you!! Thanks Kuro for the Anniversary Rewards!! You've always been so generous to us F2P in terms of your in-game rewards and bonuses. I am not dissatisfied with your anniversary rewards."
best game dev
"Good Game, but no luck at all..."
good game
Happy Anniversary yayy üéâüéâ i made it one year play this amazing gameü•≥ü•≥
Please don't attract gooner's attention.. this game was my first anime style game.. so please..
"amazing! I play this game almost everyday its so beautiful and colorful, and I'm grateful for this game."
"Best gacha game ever, really user friendly for me, a lot of people are complaining about anniversary because they want to get free 5 stars character, please please please please beggars need to chill, kuro already gave us 5 free stars character. In 2.3, we'll get over 100 pulls I think that is enough for us and there will be also so many events, I can't wait to play."
"2.2 is one of the worst and bland updates, just a small dip of connection the game becomes lag, even though my phone (pocof6) is running on a medium setting the game still lags, and it's getting worse on every update. Opening and loading takes time even though my connection is fast please fix it!"
storyline nonstop
I lost my day one account when I uninstalled. it was connected through my fb how could it be lost.
You need a high end phone to be able to play it on mobile. But that's why I bought a gaming phone...it performs perfectly now. No crashes at all even on max settings. The combat is fun but game wise there's much to be desired. I'm tired of gacha systems and I don't like stamina caps in games that are especially as fun as this one is.
I don't know why people keep complaining about the Anniversary rewards and they want free character? We have (Xiangli yao) already and those (Tourist)players are so Greedy Anyway I still support this game and thank you for the Anniversary rewards kuro ‚ù§Ô∏è (F2p btw)
love the game and the characters! excited for the anniversary
"Popular because of Anniversary trauma, Full of bugs, and optimization at release. They fix all of that, the story, the optimization for mobile, the gameplay, damn bro they literally heard the feedback. The Gameplay is so Good. love the story since Black Shores update. The combat system is absolutely Great fr. The Character Design is Beautiful almost all character can be DPS. Overall 5 out of 5, waiting another new story"
"Best game gacha, graphic AAA. developer hear every feedback from player. Every character release always awesome üëçüëçüëç"
just wanna say this game is so cool but.. with all the ungrateful spoiled brat players I think you should teach them a lesson by giving them less rewards this is technically genshin but with an opposite problem you give too much rewards that make people spoiled and genshin gives little rewards that make some people be grateful for any rewards
amazing game love the combat and exploration this is the only gacha game that i spend alot of time and not being bored
censorship sucks
"the pc version is fine, but the mobile version is unplayable because of the glitches and bugs, my mobile device is pretty decent and can run the game smoothly so theres nothing wrong with the device, the glitches that occur in my gameplay is animation glitch and character stuttering and the last is falling off the map."
"great game, I really enjoyed the content so far!"
"im not a new player. im lvl 64 Phase 7 and i will say my god the pay to win in this is so obvious. none of the difficulty pointers or levels requirement means you can do said challenges /missions, leaving you stuck with slow if no progress. it's blatantly retarded. just because your units meet the requirements, doesn't mean you can progress. you'd HAVE to get all the top tier stuffs. point is. Don't play if you're looking for fun but if you're looking to be extorted, this is your game."
10 event banners...no free hero. one of the worse predatory anniversary event I've ever seen in a gacha game.
"I love the gameplay and how interesting the story is. I love how the dev's listened to the players and are now giving 10 more free limited,standard, and weapon pulls for their anniversary."
This is the best gacha game
"actually pretty good. like a fast pace open world exploring with wifus and dodging like a madman. I like it,something to play."
make scar and geshulin playable üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°
Not stable!! Even after having snapdragon 1+ gen this game is crashing
nice game
"Played this game since it's launch, but because of the PS5 release. I had a problem with the Account Syncing. Contacted the support many times. But to no avail. My Account was lost like forever, and it's really difficult to contact game support, and when they are with you, it feels like they are in some sort of time pressure. Anyway uninstalled the Game, cause I don't want to start from scratch again. But it was an enjoyable game nonetheless."
"ive been playing this game basically since launch (stumbled across it randomly a few days after it came out) and ive always loved it. there have been normal mobile issues (lag, overheating, etc) but thats just what i expect when i play on mobile. anyway, i love the character designs and lore, the quests, and the gameplay. kuro is super generous too: as a previous genshin player, wuwa rewards have always felt too good to be true lol"
"Hot take: players acquired Cantarella for certain features. To deprive us consumers from that AFTER we pulled her is us being collateral damage. We should be compensated for that. Not blaming Kuro Games, but it is what it is."
"Keep going kuro, those greedy players are corrupted too much"
I LOVE THIS GAME
"never liked gacha games, but Wuthering Waves changed that. I was hooked from the start. I tried Genshin but couldn‚Äôt enjoy it due to my low-end device. Wuwa ran smoothly on balanced settings before, but after the new update, it lags badly and overheats, even on low settings. I want to enjoy the game‚Äôs beauty, but now I can‚Äôt even play properly. Kuro Games, please optimize it for low-end devices, or sadly, I‚Äôll have to quit‚Äîa game I really don‚Äôt want to leave."
"this game is phenomenal! the visuals, graphic C's, storyline, and the characters are really good. I don't get why other wuwa players raging just because of the 2.3 in my opinion, it was really a great deal for the players. don't say that the event sucks cause it's not. people are believing fast because of the leaks that were half meant true. I just expect the players to be more open-minded, I feel bad for the devs and the whole staff. GOOD JOB, WUWA!"
"bro. i pulled once, shorekeeper. i started playing an hour ago. just for that 5 stars"
"Wuthering Waves is awesome and full of potential. parries and dodges, use animation canceling, and build team synergy. Focus on your main DPS and farm echoes smartly. Explore thoroughly for rewards, do dailies, and upgrade wisely. For top visuals, max settings . Hopefully, they‚Äôll add ray tracing on mobile devices for even better graphics!"
it's good now but heavier
Greatest game I've ever played
still I can't play this game üò≠üò≠üò≠
"Putting this here in case the review bombing comes over to the playstore, personally I think they're being childish about the Anni rewards, how much better could it get? I was gonna skip the patch bc I wasn't wanting anyone, until I heard Brant was rerunning alongside many other limited 5*, it's a miracle for those both F2P and just joining the game. At this point, it's the complainers who are the problem, Y'all devs did the best you could with how little you have."
better than most gacha games that I've played
Went through a couple of Gotcha and this is the best so far.
I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH!!!
"I LOVE THIS GAME! What's crazy is I've watched a lot of Japanese anime and when I switched the language it blew me away how much the game reminded me of anime. The story is truly emersive, there's so much to do. It's breath of the wild meets anime meets (idek) GODS!!.. Btw I first found this game on PS5 not long ago and I play every single dayüòÆ‚Äçüí®ü•∞ (Ps): In love with Yangyangüòç but the Shorekeeperüò≠"
the gacha seems less important thats a good thing but it's has a performance issues because it's very demanding
"I'd like to say it's a great game with amazing main story and character designs along with the landscapes itself but just one small thing I wish would be possible for the exploration world quests I wish it wouldn't block off co-op or I wish you could do it in co-op if you needed help for example vigiless night or whatever it was called is pretty hard, like I'm sure character builds or leveling could help with that but it's just a struggle, otherwise I think its a great game"
"Absolutely love the game, the only game where I actually started spending"
"The astroturfing here is crazy Comparison to the worse mainstream gacha rewards to WuWa is just pathetic. I am also disappointed with the rewards but it doesn't invalidate the hard work of the devs and their timely response to feedback. I will understand disappointment but being worse is just a disingenuous take. Hoyoshill wants this game to be the same rating as genshin, wow."
"This game has no idea what it wants to be. One moment it‚Äôs a post-apocalyptic/ dystopian sci-fi game, the next it‚Äôs just another generic fantasy game. It feels like the devs just ripped off whatever was popular at the time and just hoped it would work. Heck, even the rewards are inconsistent as well, players get free 5-stars during a random filler patch, then get completely snubbed during the anniversary patch."
horrendous anniversary
"Beyond good, especially after 2.0"
Fans
"Game itself is quite fine, but: paid character censorship without any notice (illegal in most countries), shift toward predatory monetization approach and almost a mockery toward players from company CEO? This is hard to overlook. If you are interested in game - try it, but don't spend money, as someone who spent a bunch on WW - that's my advice."
W very player friendly -the dev
"Man, I love this game already."
"please make the game perfect as make the graphics should be more on highest level in actual gameplay and detailing and please remove photosensitive seizure warning cause ,please optimise the graphics and smooth because there is lots of stuckness in animals and things inside the game so please fix it and make the game smooth and please optimise it properly, even the graphics are not stable please fix it and we also want it."
1 year of game and these 12 banners are not even guarantee? What is this? A Hoyverse game? I thought you guys were better than them but this just proved that you guys are as greedy as them. I'm very disappointed Kuro. We all expected something better from you guys.
Thank you Kuro. Congratulations on the First Anniversary. üçæ üçæ üçæ
this anni proves Wuwa is out of touch . imma switch to 4 other acc to rate 4 star
A game before gacha Great game
"very every bad ""anniversary rewards"" and the ""compensation"" was even worst please five us better rewards other then that it's fine"
perfect
1st anni's rewards sucked
bad üò°üò°üò°
It's the very first beautiful game I have ever enjoyed playing ..this game devs are really good and helpful and the interface of the game makes me really happy
awesome game 100%üî•
great experience ‚ú®
DONT LISTEND TO THE NEGATIVE COMMENTS! sure the anniversary rewards is bad but just enjoy the game! The graphics and characters are amazing i love it!!
I love this game
free 5 star
"Hello Kuro Games, I'm experiencing frequent crashes while playing Wuthering Waves on my Samsung Galaxy A16 5G. The game either crashes at startup or during gameplay, especially after loading into the world. Here are my device details: Device: Samsung Galaxy A16 5G RAM: [Add your RAM, usually 4GB or 6GB] One UI Version: [e.g., One UI 5.1] Game Version: [check in-game or app info] I‚Äôve already tried: Lowering graphics settings to the minimum E"
i love and support your game.

"The game is absulutely awesome!! they have open world, you can farm so many things 10x more easily, the desgins are awesome, they have everything i ever wanted!! many players also love they **listen to customers**!!"
love the game and it's combat mechanics and the devs are very generous too (ignore the spoiled brats saying it isn't enough) and I'd say a great game all in all and so far hasn't given me trauma unlike in PGR : )
"As OG Players, This game is getting more improved since 1.0 so keep up with the good work Kuro games. I m happy to earn more gifts from you and have a great designs character and yeah I need flight to be available in all region. So please don't be rude to players that are interested in your game Kuro games, yet they need reward from you to comfort their feelings."
"i love this game keep up the good work and please don't mind those complaining too much-,-"
Best gacha game for f2p.
graphic designer OP fr
5 for the graphics and combat... also waifus
"a great game. those who r saying it's lagging or the performance is low, just upgrade ur low end old device / purchase device with compatible processor or just stop playing instead of complaining. it's a awesome game, has everything great graphics, best storyline, beautiful scenery, mind-blowing osts and what not, also cant forget awesome rewards. most ppl likes complaining just cuz their own skill issues"
"Best Gacha Ive ever played, the combat is so good, the characters are super balanced, the QOL is insane and the devs keep listening every patch. The atory is rich and the music is amazing, also the cutscenes make the MC look like boss"
"The obvious things aside, exploration in the game is very simple and relaxing. The game will have many tools that guide and handhold you from one treasure chest to another. But also because of that, you don't feel like you're exploring or on an adventure. The map is big, but fools you with few and not so engaging gameplay. If you are casual, you will appreciate that it's like a guided tour in an amusement park. But otherwise, exploration is not that fun and quite hollow. Not for me"
I didn't like how the game gameplay and the characters. do better!
I luv it so much
bad anniversary

abyssmal anniversary
"Wuthering waves is honestly not that bad but it isn't very helpful guide wise idk what to do,where to go, or even know what is happening I'm waiting for the release on ps5 then maybe I'll play it more but for now it's not really fun"
good luck Kuro
"the game is so good like better than genshin for me but the reason why i only rated 1 star is because my account got deleted after not playing for a long time, i have lots of progress on my account and then when i opened the game my account is gone"
DEVS LISTENED HAIL KURO
"I love this game,it has great character writing and amazing combat and the instructions are simple to understand,but i am disappointed about the fanservice,you don't need to sexualize a woman for them to be beautiful and seductive"
"They're really stingy for the anniversary. I've played the game since launch, supported them through all the drama, and the rewards feel like a slap in the face. I feel betrayed. I'll spend my money on a game that funds it back into the game and not use it to fund the CEO's yacht collection"
Great game.
"My dear lovely Kuro developers, do not listen to the people who are being negative to your actions. Especially to the people who are greedy for huge rewards and a huge beggar. Listen to those who are helping you from your game. Listen to the people who are actually giving positive feedback to your game and providing feedbacks from your games. Know that we really love you Kuro devs. Dont listen to those bastards. Mmmmmmmwaüòòüòòüòòüòò"
"I love from all aspects of this game, I also love playing Pgr"
Lol exhoyo copium say the anniversary rewards is trash and become beggars for free rewards. go find a job bro support the game and say 10 banner is greedy. u guys just gacha addicted. not like your exgame that dont have anniversary event in game. the event itself give lot of rewards just do the event.
"Thank you for your effort Kuro Game, i love this game"
I never thought I get this game so good I am glad that I play your awesome game.
"It's better now, but just need some optimization"
ty shorekeeper
don't bother with this game. the anniversary is genshin levels of greed LUL. They thank the players that gave them a chance despite the garbage 1.0 launch by slapping their face with spending events for anniversary hahaha
Perfect
One of the best gacha games I have ever played. I've played this game ever since 1.0 and the game quickly improved so fast. The designs and animations are amazing. A 10/10 Reccomended to play.
"bad cuz my account get bugged lol I can't even move my character, when I complaint it to the Wuwa Instagram account they didn't even responded the bug"
"it's the best game for me, salute to the devs for making this, thank you so much!"
trash mechanics
Just need male chara
Amazing game so far it has one of the graphics I have ever since in mobile the only problem I have is that the game needs more optimization the game lags alot but overall a good game
Best Game üòé
Even though my phone is a potato and can't handle much of the graphic i still love this game so once i got my phone that can handle this game atleast smoothly I'm about to go all out! Love the game
The game is very good both story and gameplay and it's easy to get immersed to the story too. The devs are very generous and kind for listening to their player since it's rarely to find a devs that listen to their player I hope you keep up the good work on making this wonderful game Devs and please don't let others take advantage on your generosity or look down on you
"W anniversary. Could've been much better. But I get it, y'all need that bag. Players don't understand that. This silly situation just proves that Kuro been giving too much free stuff and people got used to it. Unlike some similar company, Kuro is the one that been treating players good since the start, probably at the cost of their revenue.. Free pulls are lacking a little but it is what it is.. it doesn't mean that they won't be giving you more free stuff in the future..."
This So Good Story Game üéÆüî•üíñüíñ
"Decent game. Mainly playing at PC though, mobile is often too laggy."
Yesyesyesyes
very ethereal!
I have this game 5 stars in 1.0 It's 2.1 ...and it's the best..I wasn't wrong... It would be great if they added options to favorite character Thanks kuro for this amazing game... updates on anniversary: good job kuro... I loved it
best game frrr
"As a day one player, I am disappointed in the direction the game is heading. Terrible rewards on the anniversary patch with 12 50/50 limited banners. Froze review section for 2 days after the livestream, it's as if they expected the backlash but went forward with it anyway"
"listen, Kuro devs, you are being way too generous and you always seem to listen to your players, but please don't ever pressure yourself from these greedy individuals. I just recently saw the feedback, from tiktok, and any platforms and said the anniversary rewards are not enough, but they are already more than enough. You're way too good, Kuro games; you even apologized to them. We love you, Kuro devs."
I don't like anniversary rewards
love kuro games ‚ù§Ô∏è
I feel unworthy of your kindness Kuro...you are too kind to beggars
very very good game ü´°‚úåÔ∏è
"the best, graphics are great, new story are absolute Cinema waiting for my Zani to return"
Been playing since release. Still love it. No complaints. Great stories. Great characters. Fun combat. Fun exploration.
Nice game
fun combat
"Really love the game, and the upcoming anniversary rewards are really generous. idk why the players are complaining about the rewards when its already so much as the game is F2P friendly. Happy 1st Anniversary! keep up the good work!"
"""This is an amazing game‚Äîtruly fantastic! I absolutely love it. I just hope it gets further optimized for low-end phones, so even more people can enjoy it smoothly."""
"I'm a pre-registered player and I can say that it is a great game to play, especially with the combat and character designs. Very generous and new player friendly game."
best of all games
Anniversary update rewards not up to the mark for long time players.
gem bagus tapi berat di hpkh 10/10 tapi udah di apus karna berat
anniversary rewards an insult
kuro i know you guys are trying your best but please anniversary are very important so please we need better reward.
"after the latest update i kept on getting some annoying sound related problems.. idk if stuttering is the more accurate term for it. i never got that except for this latest update.. and sure enough my fps goes along with it. ive been fine with 30+ fps on anywhere except rinascita, where it would drop to 20 or less cuz its heavy. but somehow everything went worse for me after the update. tried reinstalling but never worked. i still cope for proper optimization for mid to lower end devices."
love this fantastic game
best game ever happy anniversary kuro!
"amazing game, beautiful designs with complex characters and fun exploration. deep and enchanting storys. charaters are fun and inviting and feel human. getting tired of the increasing implications between the mc and the growing amount of female characters. when they stop making female characters in love with mc and when scar and geshulin + more male characters release this will go back to 5 stars. Anniversary rewards aren't great, should've made the 20 limited reruns special instead of regular"
game baik
"LET ME ALL TELL YOU SOMETHING, THIS GAME IS PEAK. LET THEM COOKüî•üî•üî•"
Very good game
It too good I love it
I don't know why people are whining about the new anniversary rewards you guys have been generous with the rewards and we can't thank you enough
"Kuro purposely planning the anniversary fisaco and using the compensation as ""reward"" is just disgusting, I have lost all respect and trust I preciously had in them"
"bad game, always got rate off banner. please make the rate 70% for boosted banners. its so anoying seeing characters that isnt boosted in rates"
"Hey Kuro Games! I have a problem in quest ‚Äú Silent As a Falling Leaf‚Äú. I don't know how but once i left the quest area and then it started now what ever i do i can't return to that location again, it's not showing any mark or location but "" defeat the guards near the security room"". Now what i want is to add an option of resetting a quest or restarting a quest again or something else. Please this would be a great help not only for me but for the other players too."
"W, this is so player-friendly."
i got five star still good to free to play friendly
love this game
its good but i cant understand why its lagging with my lenovo y70 even in lowest graphics
pls make scar playable
"Pretty great game, had a lot of fun with it. Not very happy with the anniversary but i don't really care. The only thing i want is the 12 rerun banner to have 100% drop rate. That's all, thank you for making this game."
very exceptional I really hope we can fly in other regions
love the game but story needs a little work
"Played since day 1, and the anniversary felt like the biggest slap in the face as someone who spent money and supported the game for so long."
"We're men of culture, not children. Two stars until you remove the censorship"
Iam somewhat dissapointed on the anniverssary becuz ido deserve something.. ipaid on your 1.1 series banners and get the monthlypass on 2.0v ideserve better iam not just f2p here sighs pls don't add more fuel to fire do somthing to stop this outrage devs and pls bann all those players on your official discord their hoyobrats trying to pretend as wuwa players.
Imagine having such supportive and loyal playerbase and you treat them worse than a game who doesn't even care about their playerbase. This was my most favorite open world rpg game. but it betrayed its loyal playerbase with cheap and mid anniversary rewards which is worse than their fellow competitor games like Genshin Impact and Honkai Star Rail.
Best game
POOR ANNIVERSARY REWARDS. THIS IS HOW YOU TREAT YOUR PLAYER THAT STICK THROUGHOUT THE YEAR?
LOVE IT
"Hate the rarity, 4star characters are dying. ONLY 8 male playable characters and all. I'm slowly hating this game because of the rarity, fanservice and such. I can write an essay on as to how much I'm slowly hating this game. I'm not quitting because I'm still waiting for Jiyan's rerun. this is a great game, sure but I'm slowly hating it already."
Damn
W kuro
kuro did well. I feel bad for those a-hole who force kuro to apologize for the things they didn't do. that's unfair for what kuro already did for the players from the beginning. I believe in kuro supremacy
support all the way!!
We love your anniversary..
"I am a fan of this game and it is a good competitor to Genshin, but unfortunately this game is not very suitable for mid-range phones and it can be said that it is not very optimized and you will encounter lag and overheating, and this is very unpleasant. I downloaded the Genshin game two days ago and it is much more optimized than Weathering Views and runs much easier on my phone and has higher FPS and much less overheating. But I still want to play Weathering Views. Dear developers, please foc"
Game is pretty good and interesting..this is also my first time rating anything like this but yeah..its pretty good in all aspects!
Love it already
this game is generous on rewards so basically free to play. People are just greedy... disappointing.
So fun!!
"10/10 best game I've ever played it makes me cry tears of joy at the very thought!!!!! Super f2p friendly too!!!!! ü§§ü§§ü§§ü§§ü§§ü§§üòùüòùüòùüòùüòù Genshin could never!!!! update: do not go down the path genshin is. stop with the fan service you gooners. no one wants this, it's unnecessary. if you can't make a good game without focusing on women's bodies then just don't??"
"W game, would definitely recommend it to my friends (if I had any TwT)"
"everything is Absolute Cinema, Everything is peak and overwhelming!!!"
Kuro the goat ü§çüóø
Good
"Graphics, voice acting, character design, story and combat mechanics is just absolutely amazing. I honestly don't think there is another open world cross platform RPG that can top this. I will admit that combat in this game can be quite challenging but not too difficult to the point you want to throw your phone out of a window (based on experience from other games lol). It also almost feels like I'm playing a souls-like game due to how punishing some of the enemies are in the game."
superb game
only good at the beginning of this game. 12 banners are predatory practices this is worse than in hsr.
best f2p game
great
"You actually spit in my face by giving me this rewards kuro. 1 year of celebration of this game aniversary and the thank you letter I get, is hey you're invited but you can't eat the cake that's for new players"
trash anni rewards 30 more pulls is not enough!
Happy Anniversary Wuwa. Player since day 1.
It's still a terrible anniversary
"This game is gorgeous and very fun. The gameplay is so good and varied per character, and I could spend hours just exploring the massive, beautiful world."
"it's an extremely fun game personally, when I just roam around the game I enjoy the sceneries and how organic and visually pleasing the game is, I sometimes forget that WuWa is a Gacha game and end up playing for hours on end just to enjoy the world. though it's sad to see the most of the voices in the community doesn't appreciate this, criticism born from Abnormally high expectations berate the game and it's dev team and false information further fanning the fire Time to set the foot down"
"Anniversary is such an insult to players. There's nothing ""anniversary"" in the upcoming patch. It's just a title. What an absolute joke."
the best role playing game I have is that they are so generous on free pulls and the story and design graphic. I can say anything this is the best game for me
Hey Kuro I love this game! Don't be bothered by those players who asks for too much know that a lot of your player would still play this game come what may! Hell I would even pay for a character whom I truly love thanks again cheers for your Anniversary!
so far the best game I have ever played. there are no domains to farm for strong artifacts when you can use the enemies as your artifacts. gameplay is smooth and amazing and each character has their own unique flair
"I play wuwa on pc mostly, but mobile version seems ok. Do youself a favor and play this gem on a PC if you can."
"too much fan service, just sad."
"Great combat system and from 2.0 nice story telling and voice acting. But devs (or Tencent which aquired the majority of shares from Kuro games) are showing their greediness with the Anniversary patch where they put 12 banners all with 50/50 and giving almost the same number of free pulls as the other normal patches... very disappointed, I was expecting a Ciaccona for free or a 100 pulls extra for free so we could use them on whatever banner we wanted and they would've still made money..."
"Wuwa‚Äôs really fun and the bestest for me. Farming astrites, echoes, and other stuffs is easy for me‚Äînot sure for the others, lol. Though, there are some parts where it is challenging, but tutorials helps me and i‚Äôve soon find the quest easy! There are just some times where my iPad(12.9, m2) lags, especially at some characters‚Äô bursts like changli, but that‚Äôs alright. Not really a big problem for me. Also, i love how they reply fast, hours or 1-3 days, to my concerns(email). Great game!"
One of the best gacha games I played!
This game is very good now...thank you and the hitting issue is very less. And keep improving
I love the game so much but the game itself forced me to quit cuz of how my phone is always framedropping even tho my phone can handle genshin impact on 60 fps. Ngl they should've give some love on mobile players. It's been a year. still nothing change in mobile.
I like it
"best gacha game ever. the graphics, combat, UI, character design everything is peak"
"This game have a potential, but there's just some flaw in the gameplay itself. Sometimes getting stucked on some places and sloppy parkour movements which sometimes is hard to control. Adding jump action while disguised on one quest would be helpful as well, or return to previous location. I got stucked in that particular quest and couldn't get out but overall this is game is really amazing and rewarding. Just need some movement mechanics impovement while exploring would be great"
aw man it got censored anyway game is good
"Day 1 Player here, And I still enjoyed playing this game. The story animations are insane like, its literally a movie. The combat is very fun and the game offers a massive map with top tier graphics. Unlike other gacha games, The dev are actually really generous and listens to player feedbacks. (April 22, 2025. Though I actually feel a bit bad. The 1 year anniversary rewards are fine but.. Players complain about it?? Come on guys, the update will already give like tons of new things to do. )"
"Lackluster anniversary rewards, they already saw what happened to Genshin and they just repeated the same thing."
excellent game
"The best open world game I have played. The gameplay, designs, and lore is pretty good devs are very generous and listens to it's players and works hard for the improvement of the game. coming from 1.0 player I fell in love with this game because of its uniqueness like being post apocalypse themed and the mysterious lore behind who really is the rover and I can't wait to know who really that goddess we met in the beginning of the story."
love the dev :>
"Kuro really needs to step it up. The Wuthering Waves 1st anniversary was a massive disappointment. We‚Äôve been supporting this game since day one, and what do we get? No free five-star, not even a standard unit. Just 30 pulls and a glider? Seriously? What makes it worse is that Kuro gave us Xiangli Yao for free in version 1.4, but not even a free five-star for the actual anniversary? That‚Äôs just backwards. How does that make any sense? We deserve more for our loyalty & support. Do better KuroüôÑ"
Extremely good game with developers that actually listen and care for it's players
love this game from my heart. Devs listen their players. Every characters is useful in this game even 4star charectors keep it up
my favorite gacha game ever <3
the anniversary rewards are disappointing.
"Trash dev. 1st anniversary rewards were a joke, so they backtracked after all of the backlash. It's too late though, maybe give generous rewards from the get go. Just a thought...."
"I really loved this game until I met that Bangladeshi weird cringe public named Toriq Himal. I considered this game peak, however seeing fandom like that person called Toriq disgusted me in every possible ways in wuthering waves Sorry again devs it's not your fault. I'm not blaming you but your fanbase :"")"
"it's really just like genshin only with a huge makeover and woth a sort of survival futuristic theme instead of an adventure fantasy vibe. really awesome for those of us not wanting the too easy or annoying lost drops when you open chests and beat monsters. the only major downside to this game really is that it keeps crashing when I do the main quest on my android and it's a newer version, even if it's a cheaper model."
"after one year they still didn't fix the lag problem, graphics aren't THAT high but the game needs 3000 dollar pc not a good performance"
"I been playing wuwa since the release of the games and so far I enjoy it a lot even though my phone can't handle the unreal engine I still can play it ,I already tried lower everything on my settings but still a bit laggy but with cooler I can play it smoothly so I really grateful that I can still play this game and can join all the events in this games,thank you to all developer who work hard to improve this game and I know you all do everything to made this game good so please don't give up!ü§ó"
"Kuro I enjoyed the game very much and Im hoping to see your awesome works in future updates. You gave players enough,please don't overdo it and not be taken advantage of because of how generous y'all are."
"Good story with beautiful scenery, and cool gameplay. Im looking forward for future updates"
my main gripe regarding the anni are the rewards. even if you didn't give 5 star selector at the very least increase the amount of pulls we can gather from the anni events
"Amazing game. playing for some time now. Easy to grind and absolutely f2p friendly. Almost have all limited characters along with their signature weapon. Storyline is amazing, characters are well designed and combat seems fluid and flashy the way I like it. The only issue I have is that my phone really hits when I play since this game is very demanding in graphics. I would love if devs optimize the game for mobile phones. Overall amazing and fully satisfied."
'best game ever played!'
thanks to the devs for their support and care about players and gratefulness we continue to support you‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
Why I can't install in my phone? please lessen it
yes king
"very satisfied with this game, it has good graphics and Visual effect and the combat style is very addictive ypu can dodge and parry easily, compare to genshin impact it's trash."
Disappointing 1st yr anniversary.
Best mobile game
"very enjoying playing this game, the gameplay are so fun and engaging. the graphics also very beautiful, I'd say this is Best looking gacha game in mobile. Dev are pretty generous, F2P are treated very well in this game, but please consider to support the game because they treat their player well."
uhu they sure copying everything even the anniversary reward aslo trash haha glad didn't get info the game haha
bad anniversary rewards do better kuro games
wuwa devs is top tier!!!
best game overall kuro don't listen the negative people's just do your best and provide better content üòâ
terrible aniversary rather than giving compensation of 10 pulls you should have removed 50/50 from rerun banners
"Since 1.4 they are slowly becoming another hoyo. The community is full of toxic positivity, burning and suppressing all disagreements, even if it's a valid criticism. Point out inconsistent plot in 2.1 = burned online, called hoyoshills. 1st Anniversary confirm it, they are on the path of becoming another hoyo. The ammendmend log-in reward is the killing blow to my trust. They are DEFINITELY becoming another hoyo. It's never the reward, it's the trust that cause the issue in CN"
peak Gaming W Kuro games (take back what u gave us)
"Great game, and one of the most generous gacha games out there during launch date. Keep it up devs üëç"
"beautiful, good gameplay"
"great game, Great enjoyment,,Just what a Masterpiece,,Just lags sometimes horribly but Just a everything in this game is a masterpiece. You are doing your best and Always remember that a true Wuwa player won't complain about your character designs and other small mistakes.You should learn to stay safe from the Hoyoshills,,thanks for your effort of creating such an amazing game . the Only thing we could even think of improving is making the game smooth for even medium grade devices. keep it upüçÄ"
"Game had potential, but the recent censorships and the abysmal anniversary rewards showed the devs don't care about the playerbase and it is no better than other titles preceding it. Do not bother playing it."
"Best open world game so far.. i try other simillar game but this game are more fun and enjoying.. best thing is the daily reard are easy.. 5mnt and done.. sometimes i don't have much time, this is the best.."
the anniversary awards are disappointing. the lack of male characters is also vey severe. the last four star was in 1.3. I am just disappointed
"The ""new"" anniversary reward just feels like something you planned to give in case of a riot Still 1/5 We'll see how the steam release goes"
ghatiya aniversary rewards
Overall a very good game but stingy anniversary rewards (no free 5*) even hoyoverse gave more rewards edit: glad they responded but not enough
"if u fail gacha, it will be a terrible grind, if u succeed, either can enjoy the exploration or get more reward Very nice game üëç"
I'm not giving it a 5 star till wuwa release scar
less reward than expected on aniversary
don't listen to other player. kuro there just greedy just do what u do normal If u keep listening to those greedy player they will do it again don't babysit them if the anniversary are good they don't get. they don't listen properly are read. only real kuro gamer will appreciate your doing keep it up and thanks you
They should keep the rated 16+
"I played a lot of gacha games like genshin impact, HSR, zzz, even punishing gray raven but wuthering feels different in turms of combat and story I love it üß° I pulled jinshi and it is magnificent to look at this character. People may say the design is go√≤ner but I would say great job wuwa because if ther freely do what the want the game is going to improve in many different ways ü§ûüèªI hope they provide us with cantarella type of character in future because wee users know what wee want notethis"
restoring rating as Kuro stated they will acknowledge their og players.
"It is a very enjoyable game, an absolute cinema storyline and devs always listen to player"
tysm for a Shorekeeper
the best wuwa
"While giving an extra 10 pulls for limited, weapon and standard banner is a nice gesture, it doesn't excuse the ""anniversary""/glorified rerun banner. If there are any other secret rewards/changes for 2.3 I will give 5* again, but for now it's 3*. Afterwards, should that be it for the apology, I will wait for the next big event/anniversary to reevaluate my rating."
Can't even play it as it always kicks me out to the home screen ü§¶‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
"This is the most greatest gacha game i ever play in my life, I really like the story also... is very familiar with your previous gacha game, Punishing: Grey Raven Animation is good as well. The gameplay does not like the other RPG Gacha Game gonna build the meta team or something else. It's more familiar than Devil May Cry Gameplay can use one character for cookin'. Edit: Fix your install issue, and ill give 5 star back to you."
"please add indonesian subtitles, i like this game, but i don't understand most story in this game"
"very good game,just a tiny problem they aren't making a bikini skin for calcharo please kuro devs i beg"
Anniversary rewards are a joke.
The most lagged game i played
This game is fun and has brought hours of entertainment. Crashes do happen but this dev team put a lot into this game and deserve 5 stars.
good game
What a game
Genshin players writing essays on why this game sucks on Day 1 lol...
"Best mobile game when it comes to graphics, exploration and combat gameplay definitely a chefs kiss."
"Best combat mechanic, best character design, best map exploration, best story"
"dear kurogames, at least make the banners guaranteed for the anniversary if we aren't getting any five stars. I mean what is this 12 banners not even 50 pulls from events is atrocious. Please kindly listen to the player bases and loyal wuwa fans. thank you. also please unlock the flight mechanic in the old region. I hope you respond soon and giving out 10 limited character pulls as an apology is just blasphemy. I hope you don't tarnish your reputation."
It is one of the best gacha games I have ever played plenty of rewards and the easy event ton of free rewards
good
"Saya sangat senang dengan perkembangan yang terus membaik dari game ini, semangat terus Dev, saya akan mensupport kalian dengan selalu top up monthly hahahaha"
"The game works way better for me now but my rating doesn't change, the story has too much glazing for the main character and it gets old fast. I'm also just not a fan of the harem trope so yeah. Exploration and getting characters is still fun, and levelling them up when I come back every once in a while is easy too. Biggest complaint is over other characters whole personality liking the Mc and how there are only 3 male limited characters at the time I'm playing 04/21/25"
game baik
the best game i ever played so far!
"Deleting. The game itself is beautiful, but it won't stop crashing. It says I don't have internet when I can play other games like Genshin Impact or Skyrim without so much as a single lag. I can't even beat the beginning boss with this. I've turned my graphics down and everything."
"This game is absolutely amazing. The characters are well written and enjoyable. The story is good especially in 1.3 and up. The combat is so fun, fluid and challenging. The world has much to offer and explore. They lost player appreciation it seems."
I love this Game
Great game my device has no issue for at all... as for the people that are complaining that the game has problems don't the game it's ur device that has a problem.
best üî•üî•üî•
"Horrible 1st anniversary communication and decisions. After the backlash a simple 10/10/10 to shut up the people criticizing them, a shame really. Such a great game in such a competitive market and the company decides to betray it's ''Rovers''"
peak
"predatory practices, anti consumer system, gambling content."
"this game is fun, even though it's kind of confusing for breakthrough the character level"
"developers purposely make bad decisions to test waters and try to see how low they can go without getting players mad. annoying cycle they keep using in order to seem like they're caring and listing. do not fall for this tactic as it was shown by their anniversary announcement. at the end of the day, this is a gacha game and these developers will always try to maximize making you spend money."
Fix the re run. Too many at once
"thank you kuro for all the optimization, I am really grateful because of the new echoes and qol updates and for all the rewards you have given, please don't give up and keep going:)"
I'm sorry
"Wuthering Waves is a breathtaking masterpiece! The stunning visuals, coupled with the engaging storyline and fluid combat, create an unforgettable gaming experience. The vast open world is brimming with secrets to uncover and challenges to overcome, ensuring countless hours of immersive gameplay. A true standout in the action RPG genre, Wuthering Waves is a must-play for any gamer!"
very nice
2.3 is saved hail kuro for actually listening üíûüíûüíû
Excellent game the story is intriguing and the Characters are interesting the main Characters the Rover's are great units in particular and though the game is still young it is pacing very well.
"The fun in story, combat and exploration doesn't feel like free to play game at all. very well done Kuro games üëè thanks for the experience!"
"Everytime about this game is soo good.... everyone is talking about that...but this game is being more like fanservice. Characters are mostly waifus, I will prefer well designed male characters too...not just Waifus...devs show some male Resonators too...( btw I'm a maleüôÇ in case u suspect me a girl )"
"Started off so well until they decided to turn the anniversary into a whale fest, so many banners with the same amount of rewards as a normal patch brings. Anniversary banner is just a re-run banner, no guarantee, no selector for a limited character, no free 5 star to bring people in, no map expansion, spaced out rewards so by the time you get the summons the banners would have ended. I hoped this game would be different then genshin impact but it's just the same."
best game
one of the best games ever. Op dev team always listening to us unlike genshins team
2.3 patch is good but the anniversary rewards is bad so 3 only
Bagus bgt njir
"The game itself is average or perhaps somewhat good. But as with any gacha game, this game is also just a gambling simulator, time waster and bait for people who are weak willed of the modern generation. Now lets talk about the company behind this game. The company advertises itself as a saint and a good company who cares about its player base, but infact it is just another greedy company which exploits its player base, mainly through gambling and stuff. They are extremely greedy. IHopeTheyRot."
"luv u, LES GO"
"More better rewards or merciful banner system for the anniversary, please."
they just have to ruined the 1 anniversary of wuthering wave so disappointed
"awful customer service, awful glitchy sound effect bug, laggy interface at the new weekly event, and also dissapointing anniversary events. who gives a shi about free limited char, but only extra 15 pulls? that just insane way to disrespect the players that keep playing this game through up and down"
disappointed on anniversary
This game is so so much fun to play this IS Best of the Best game in my whole 24 years of life and i know this gonna be the no 1 game for me i never comment or give review on any game But this one I will do Because this game has something no game have I CAN'T THANK YOU FOR MAKING THIS GAME KEEP UP THE GOOD WORK FOR MAKING THIS GAME THIS MUCH FUN THANK YOU VERY MUCH üëç
disappointing anniversary rewards
Goood game however it has a very BAD SERVER CONNECTION! always reconnecting most of the time
absolutely loved it .....the optimisation is peak and the characters ‚ú® hey kuro games can you do something about resonance beacon like its hard to see them in map like we cant spot the icom fast with eyes
the story is getting better and better shorekeepers relationship is soo peak Anniversary is very bad
"Anniversary rewards are disappointing. Really expected more from this company. If they don't fix it, they'll see a huge chunk of players leave. We all quit GI and HSR and we gave a second chance when the game released already, we're not waiting any longer and forgiving stuff like this anymore. If nothing is done quick, this is it for a lot of us. Do better Kuro, you've done it before. oh and if you're crying about censorship knowing fully well that they were forced to do that, then u're rtrded"
"Keep up the good work, Kuro games! Sincerely, a Changli enthusiast."
kuro game Just has to runied the 1 aniversary of wuthering wave
"This game is a big hype. There are a lot of improvements since release. I'm not gonna lie, I downloaded it before for a new experience, but it's not what I expected, thus I deleted. It was a good decision that I downloaded it again, since, I am loving it."
fantastic üî•
left genshin because the devs didnt seem to care about the players and came to this game thinking they might be different. how wrong i was
little bugs and lack of smoothness and a little bitt comoplicated system in comparison of other gacha games I am still playing so many gacha games in this time but the game which feels the least smooth is Wurthring waves otherwise everything else is fine
"Game is great overall. I love the characters, however Devs are too stingy so you probably won't be able to get all the characters you want. Even for anniversary they announced how much they'll give and it's very little. I thought that their generosity will carry over from Pgr,but it seems they're too famous and successful now to think about us :("
paid banner with 50/50 chance. how low you have fallen Kuro. no reward for anniversary.
"BAD ANNIVERSARY REWARDS, DON'T GIVE US SILENCE."
"Edit: I reduce my score from 5 stars to 1 star. The game itself is great, that hasn't changed. But Kuro Games has a track record for being generous and to go by a ""player first"" approach. But when they had their chance to solidify their status as the most generous and player friendly mainstream gacha they dropped the ball. Their upcoming anniversary, while it has great content, is very lackluster with the rewards. And the special anniversary banner still has a 50/50 and does not carry over."
i love yangyang
Give us better anniversary rewards and QOL that the player wants! Not what the devs wants!
better than genshin
A bit worse genshin copy. With a miniscule better rewards in their anniversary.
sad that i have to give it one star but brotha.. it won't even let me open it. like i've been waiting for the 17 damn GB to download to just do nothing and exit the game in 3 sec. it looks fun ig but 17GB is a lot to just be left with the game exiting on itself.
WHY SO LAGGY? GRRRRR IHATE!!!!!
The game is going in a bad direction like all gacha games monetization-wise. Steer clear and spend elsewhere.
GREEDY ! Just like every other Gacha.
"Story and Localization could be better, there's lack of presented connection between playable characters except with main character. Combat is fun (Illusive Realm makes it more fun, waiting for its return) and QoL updates very frequent. Some NPCs look way too good, it's a waste to lock them away inside quests... please, Carlotta, I want to marry- I mean, hang out with your Grandfather."
"the anniversary rewards are lackluster. the patch is a filler. There are 12 banners rerunning on the next patch. what happened to the most ""generous"" gacha game?"
"i appreciate the game very much as well as the developer's listening to the players wishes, i enjoy the story and everything, there are some factors that i couldn't consider but I'll still give it a 5 star for the awesome gameplay and concept it portrays, as of today i hope the anniversary rewards could be improved, it's not bad but it would be fun if there are more astrites that we could obtain through events, but i appreciate the efforts kuro, well done and thank you"
Devs listen to feedback and that alone makes this worth it to play in the long run
"Loved playing this game! However, I do get issues such as lag spikes or random crashes, and after the 2.0 update, my phone's unable to run the game :( Hopefully I can get back to it someday‚Äî would love to continue my journey <3"
Cyberpunk edgerunner I'm coming.
good
I love this game since beta and launch I'm excited for it's 1st anniversary but the only problem is the fake fans of wuwa criticism just because they came from hoyo and spoiled brats
nice very beautiful game
Why can't you just apply the censorship to the CN server only?
very good game üòÑ
suppeerr
"After 2.0 update: The ""patch/content"" is good but ""aniversary rewards"" are disappointing. If they announce better rewards I will increase the rating. This game is not perfect but it is still a really good game. To all the ""haters"" saying this ""game"" (not anniversary) is worse than Genshin probably don't know about guaranteed weapon banners. Not trying to spread hate but asking for people to wait for Dev's response before hating it."
PLEASE do something about optimization for us mobile playersüò≠üôè I really did gave this game a chance 'cause I'm really interested in the story and love Brant and MRover but godd*amnit I couldn't play it smoothly and would always lag even when my wifi is goodü•∫üò≠
very bad anniversary.. we're hoping something special but we got disappointment..only 37 pulls for 10 rerun banner ..how it make senses.. I'm sure this game also same like money grabber like other gacha game üò¥üò¥ I wasted my time watching whole anniversary stream better I can sleep 1hour
"No hate just my personal opinion..I think WuWa is sm better than Genshin... I've been playing genshin for years, But this game is so cool unlike Hoyo, kuro is really generous and they really care abt the players...Also the storyline graphics are beyond the expectations...And i luv the skip option in storyline which can be used for other quests like side quests... Overall this is my top fav game in RPG genre..."
very demure
the game is a lot more kinder in rewards than genshin it has better fast paced fighting good storyline and art
COOL H*NTAI GAME
vvvvvgoooooooddddd game
fix your censored garbage
"The anniversary version is basically a robbery. Max levels of FOMO, Zani is dependent of Phoebe, 10 reruns + 10 weapon reruns, Ciaconna, and Catherthya around the corner, all at the same time wrapped up with very low amount of anniversary rewards. Huge disappointment."
Terrible anniversary rewards
abysmal anniversary. They don't appreciate the support from players. They only want to make as much money as possible from the people who play their game.
game with hard to win 50/50 almost all of my character win lost win lost
good game and you kid buy in the game 0 usd look kid 1st 1 hour to 4 hour no link in the card you kid get wait and money plan you kid spend money is ok But get the limit start game 10 hour to 35 hour all the game/story game is ok time limit is 25 min to 1 hour kid is over 1 hour the game get the time limit 3 hour
been day 1 player and I enjoyed it despite all performance issues and later on with an amazing came back they had in 2.0 but the recent anniversary rewards kind of felt like they ignored players like me that were there since the beginning and focused more on returning and new players but I will give it fair score.
better anniversary rewards pls
"the game itself is great, but its optimization for a mobile game is not really the best, most ppl who use the phone as their gaming console are the ones not able to get high end devices, so mobile games need to be optimized to be run by majority of the phones, my phones runs most games in the highest graphics (ex: genshin and hsr) but for wuthering, there is a lot of lagging, glitching, frame dropping and crashing, and I mean ALOT"
"Kuro used to be generous to their player but after Tencent joined in, Kuro stopped being generous. 1st anniversary supposed to be memorable and not like any other patch. But this anniversary is such a let down Kuro. It's so sad to see you like this"
I love Gathering wives
good story line or animation
"Underwhelming anniversary rewards. The game was generous at first because the launch was a disaster, the community was dead, etc. Now that the fans made the game alive they get these underwhelming rewards. Not asking for a 5* but the only thing we get is a skin for an accessory we rarely use in the new region and a little bit of pulls than usual."
ABSOLUTE CINEMA‚úãüèªü•∂ü§öüèª
Recommended to play this game! never seen such a game like this (real honest review)
"Regarding the layout of the buttons in-game, I want to place the dash/dodge button at the top left so that I can press it with my left index finger, but the map button cannot be moved. I hope that in the next update, all buttons can be customized freely according to my preferences."
Love the game!
well Balance game its really fun to play and its not a f2w its kinda f2p also because of there amazing rewards thas all(:
"welp, ü´†"
sick ü§¢
"I have just recently returned to the game, and I have got to say quite the improvement for device compatability. But my main issue is that it eats way too much storage. Mainly because there are still old files left in the game, like voicelines and cutscenes that have already been completed. I would suggest the option to remove them after completing the quest to save storage for upcoming updates."
Really disappointing anniversary rewards. Dont become hoyo
The game makes the CPU very touching the CPU for phones and the game is lag his own
"The game lags after 15,20 mins it's need some optimization"
I really like the game it's super nice üòä
Game is amazing. It just lacks optimization. And side quest are too long sometimes hope there will be some changes in next update
keeps crashing and takes to much to gain anything in game. feels like a chore playing past ar50
Really disappointing since the upcoming banners are more on females like why are you wasting the game's potential. It should be balanced like wth kuro RELEASE MORE MALE CHARACTERS I'm tired of seeing female characters. Can't you just balance it??? I thought the game would improve since I played wuwa since release and kept hoping that it would not turn to some gooning sht game. REALLY DISAPPOINTING LIKE FRFR. I love the game but it's really annoying that yall keep releasing more female characters
Very unsatisfying anniversary reward..
"I keep losing my 50/50 (i hate encore,calculator) this game also have one of the worst anniversary btw"
"I played with my friend and be playing since pre then came back 1.3, ngl THE STORY, CHARACTERS,FIGHTS, QOL and Exploration be goated fr"
"good game , could do better"
"Jogo excelente, por√©m por conta de lags, n√£o no jogo em si, mas sim em meu smartphone eu resolvi desinstala-lo at√© conseguir um celular melhor, entretanto o jogo √© √∫nico com combate, explora√ß√£o, din√¢mica, filtros cinematogr√°ficos e hist√≥ria in√©ditas, entretanto como muitos brasileiros estou um tanto chateado com a falta de legendas em meu idioma nativo PT-BR, logo mais isso n√£o √© motivo para dar uma estrela por um motivo t√£o insignificante."
it's great but still need to fix
Impressive but some are too hard and makes you wants to stop playing. call it skill issue but I want to WIN and in a COOL way. I don't want to spend time learning about the boss and getting good at the game I want to win because this is a game.
"great game , better then Genshit"
Mid story. terrible rewards. no respect
good gameüëç
i love it
Great game the devs are always listening and it's still a gacha so you won't get everything but will get everything you need and all units are unique making what you own have value.
bad anniversary
disappointment just disappointment if you have gave something special in anniversary it would be great but it's still same even reward is same just painted as this anniversary reward but it isn't
worst luck worst rating
they got greedy and became predatory with their game to the point to not rewards for old players
"This game is really promising. The combat is awesome, the open world, the characters are beautiful."
Devs who are severely out of touch with their players. Remember to appreciate the ones who kept your game alive.
best game I have ever played this good and quite rewarding so just close your eyes and hit download button and enjoy the world of wuthering wave
"Great gameplay, content and worldbuilding..... QoL updates with improvemnts are positive.... However this anniversary reminds me that every gacha is so predatory that the above is simply forgotten and replaced by a new game. As a new console player i can pull one thing out of 24 banners in a month. How is this fun? Camellya and shorekeeper just were on banners, was i suppose to skip them? Until Kurogames gives me respect to my time and money, I won't support them anymore."
"bad boss fights, heavily reliant on Meta characters, horrible echo stat grinding, good story, amazing graphics (obviously), good combat, overall it's 3/5 game is going to kill itself if it continues to only listen to the Chinese player base but then again that is there target so I doubt it'll last longer then 2-3 years but I may be wrong. They need ALOT of tips on how to make good boss fights cause they all suck legit I've played to many soulslike games and other genres and these legit are bad"
All Good Experience But You Can Add 1/2 Mb App & Wabsite To Redeem Code And Other Normal Reward Clam Without Opening Game It's Very Hard To Open Pc And Game Same Days üò≠‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçü©π Please Just Add Wabsite To Easy My Life I Am Stell Waiting To Reply üò∂
DAMN!!!GIVE ME MORE LIMITED 5 STAR!! I LOVE YOUUUU MWUAHH MWUAHHH
great game
"the anniversary rewards. wuwa, do better."
"Very good combat for gacha game. Graphics good but not best. About story, until 1.4 story is bad. But in 1.4 and after story is improved. for 2.2 is peak. Last thing, its a gacha game but still f2p friendly. They gives you a lot of asterites for characters and weapons. Normally my score of this is 5 star. However 2.3 ""anniversary"" is literally joke. Until they fix this anniversary my score is 3 star."
it's truly tragic want to support this game but I can't after this disappointing anniversary livestream
1 star because I pulled for the lastest character cantarella which I enjoyed but after 2 week kruo games decided to change the characters crotch appearance without notifying the player base and some might say it's not a big deal but to me it is.changing a characters detail after I spent money to purchase it without tell me leave a bad taste in my mouth I won't be spending money on this game anymore unless the issue is fix or address it.and it gets worst with the most predatory anniversary...
DEVS LISTENED
"One of the best games, thank you ü•∞"
This is the best Anime Style or Gacha Game in all of the Internet! Don't believe me? Try it out yourself.
"this game has continually delivered. after just one year it's give from a clunky release to a stream lined, feedback driven, engaging game. It goes without saying that the combat system is the best I've seen in this genre... easy to learn but has a high skill cap."
the only gacha I can say feels like an actual game rather than a anime girl collector. a lot of the complaints i see are the same sort of people you see at a protest but don't know why they are there.
the game stutters a lot. even on high end devices. 0/10.
Greedy devs ruin what could be a fun game. Stay away unless you want to spend a lot of money for very little reward.
"Love the combat. I will admit that it's difficult for me to parry/dodge, but I'm sure I'll get good at it eventually. Eng VA could use a little bit more feelings to it. My phone is a OP9 and it does get heated up while playing at the default graphic settings. Once the game gets more optimization throughout the months, I'm sure it'll be a beast. Thank you for the game! Hope you keep up the good work. Edit: W, this is very player-friendly"
I love it
Looking forward to the future
absolute cinema
"Game decided to go down the Hoyoverse route which terribly started to get worse when they revealed the Predatory 12 banners that people can pull for and calling it 'player-friendly'. Providing very few rewards for it's anniversary while also cutting short 2.2 patch by 10 days. This new 2.3 patch that is coming is just a cash grab at this point. It can also be possibly that this was all to drama farm revolving around ""Kuro games listens to its player base"". What a huge disappointment to players."
bad anniversary rewards
the best gacha game ever
Game's anniversary rewards makes Star Rail's look like a MrBeast's giveway
"Censoring Cantarella and Fluerdelys costumes on the game, especially when Cantarella has been sold to millions of players, is very anti consumer Okay so now right after the censorship the rewards loyal players got for anniversary were absolutely horrible"
i love this game man
anniversary rewards is trash
"Updated pre 2.3: Greedy destroys everything. Kuro didn't learn... Updated version 2.2. 3/5 because I lost my 50/50 üò≠ Updated 3/18. In addition to removing the $5 Gplay coupon in the store, Kuro also upscale the difficulty of WhiWa to a unreasonable level, just like they are following the steps of Hoyoverse on punishing player base."
I like this game so much
the game getting stale and the story just absurd and bland no indepth in crucial aspect
"Abysmal Dogshit. game is peak, but only on pc Hell yeah ts is even worse than genshin in terms of performance like how tf is my phone able to play genshin with high-highest setting with 40-45 stable fps meanwhile cant even play ts on the LOWEST SETTING EVER and still fluctuate, smh.üíî"
"The combat is stellar, and they put a lot of effort into cutscenes and cinematics, but there's a lot of other issues. They never release new 4 stars, and on the rare occasion that they do, they're useless. They've completely stopped releasing male characters, creating a serious imbalance. The Anniversary rewards are horrible, and the ""Outfit Voucher"" only reducing outfit prices by a tiny bit is laughably stingy. I don't think WuWa's good qualities outweigh the bad anymore. Not player friendly."
"The game is very laggy even at the lowest settings, it's literally unplayable because of the lag and frame drops. Other than that the story is quite good and mechanics are good too. I hope the optimisation gets better."
The jiggle physics and barely any males and then Cantarella's design was just the last straw for me. Rinascita being preplanned with what they put out tells me exactly the type of player Kuro wants and the reviews of the people complaining about the censorship says they got just the player base they wanted. Enjoy your perverts Kuro.
after the update the game is too laggy for me
"12 banners at once as an anniversary gift? Actual greed, not player friendly. The banners aren't even 100%"
optimize the game. texture not loading properly
"Congratulations for creating this game. from great details, amazing cutscenes, being responsible and giving your best everyday. you deserve a 5 star for it. Thank you kuro!"
the best game in gacha world especially genshin
"Excellent Art, Good Character Design, and Good Performance of the story. HOWEVER, the problems are: Dishonest about the modifications of the paid content. High price to the paid content/character. Mediocre storyline. Horrible PR & customer service teams. Summary: I wouldn't recommend spending money on this game."
"I love your games kuro, both pgr and wuwa, I hope you will keep up the good work!!"
Game server has latency issue all the time since launch I'm in asia and i play in asia it's practically reconnecting to server all the time while other games runs normally with no ping issue there's no two step authentication yet for account safety and optimise the updates instead of forcing us to re-download the whole game every patch
"1 year anniversary for the game has been announced and the rewards are fantastic devs have done a great job so far and can wait to see more. lots of people are complaining about the anniversary rewards but they are the ones that cannot understand that the game is not required to give away free characters at the anniversary, ESPECIALLY because the game has already given out TWO free five star characters in the past, expecting the anniversary rewards to exceed that is stupid."
perfect
optimization ain't s***
"The game is good, but the company is trying to see how much they can extract from the players without giving anything in return. Just another gacha company."
1st Anniversary rewards are pitiful. It's literally a spending event.
Imagine trying to introduce predatory summoning banners yet gaslight the players into thinking it is player friendly. somehow giving a $2 discount for a $40 skin is a hyped event
BEST GAME EVER HOPING WE WILL GET ALOT MORE OF ASTRITES!!
even tho I really really love the game but the anniversary Rewards are very very bad hope you change it
"Played the game since day 1 and was so looking forward for the anniversary only to be letdown like this. Everything in the anniv was catered for new players which is probably their target as they prepare to release the game on steam. Veteran players got very little love. This may well be my last time spending actual money on this game as I revert back to being f2p unless things improve. What a shame, really"
Waiting for that cyberpunk collab üî•üî•üî•
Don't bother investing time into playing this game since the devs have made it clear they would rather reward newer/returning playing in this upcoming anniversary than the ones that have logged in every day
No Anniversary rewards
"Very Disapointing 1st year anniversary . Absoulute horrible rewards. MY Rating change due to , they do not respect the older player and no appreciaition for player that has supported them during thier toughest time."
I like the gameplay but after playing for about 3 weeks I can't open the game anymore please fix this
kuro listens to players
"I do like it alright on mobile, just wish I had a controller for a better combat experience."
1 anni soo bad do better
I hope Kuro would really take time reading this: I love Wuthering Waves soo much! It's a beautiful game and I am grateful for your continuous optimization in the game. You are always generous with the rewards. It's just that some people are way to hard to please. And I'm really sad with such critics after the Livestream. I'm a day 1 player and will always support Wuthering Waves.
guaranteed weapons and free resonance sign me the heck up (fix ani rewards)
good game
Best game üòç
"I really love the gameplay, character design, event, story and everything but the reason that I give only 3 star is the game update. Everytime new update release, every file that's downloaded in-game is disappear and I need to download over 20GB everytime when the update release. That makes me really sad and stop to play this game but I won't. So, please do something about that.ü•π"
Love this game
"W, this is so payer-friendly!"
So sad to see such a good game have such a bad anniversary
"I had a thought during 2.0 recently: ""Hmm, I could fast travel to that quest. Nah I'll fly."" Flying in Rinascita is so fun and so freeing for an open world game. I sincerely hope they keep it going forwards. So many QOL traversal mechanics, the world feels huge but fun to navigate. New patch preview was not player friendly, and kind of insulting..."
"u failed on the anniversary rewards. Kuro, you have painted yourself as a company that's incredibly generous. Now there's a outrage because your anniversary is underwhelmed. Remember, the first anniversary sets the precedent on how the others go"
it's was very niceeee!
im a day 1 player. stuck through the whole disaster of a launch and a horrendous 1.2 patch... all that on top of endless bugs. ur giving out more rewards to whales and newbies instead of appreciating everyone specially THE ONES THAT STAYED THROUGH ALL THE BAD TIMES. nah.. here's a 2 star kuro.
"The game is with stunning graphics and intricate character design. Each character feels unique, with personalities that shine through engaging dialogues and lifelike animations. The plot is captivating and interesting, full of twists that keep you hooked. Gameplay is smooth, with intuitive controls and fluid mechanics that make both combat and exploration fun and immersive. Overall, it's a game worth recommending because of its excellent quality, entertainment value, and interesting plot."
very good game
good job on the anniversary rewards lmao
"10/10 will recommend to anyone, love the wonderful characters, artwork, gorgeous skill effects, relaxing open world exploration, especially the amazing soundtrack! The game just keep improving. Joined because of Camellya, and will continue to stay because of her!!"
"Disappointing Anniversary reveal to say the least. 12 banners running at the same time, only 30pulls?, the anniversary banner re-runs have a 50/50 mechanic? Are you serious? atleast make it 100% chance of pulling atleast ONE Resonator. Thank you for the free glider skin, that makes up for everything... Even HSR gave out a free 5* limited character, imagine. just rework the rewards or banner system atleast so players can feel like they getting something in anniversary don't make wuwa a whale game"
"great game ,nice designs but I can only install it and not run it,hope they will add a cloud client soon,for lower specs device and for them to be able to enjoy what this game has to offer ."
No need To say Anything It's Just Perfect!
even copied genshins terrible first anniversary
playing Wuthering waves since day 1 leaving genshin impact but seeing the Wuthering waves anniversary rewards made me kinda disappointed kinda regretting my decision
Á¶èÂà©Â§™Â∑Æ
best game out there with Triple A experience and peak quality story.
very nice game
"""W, this is so payer-friendly"""
"I would've given this a solid 5 but the most frustrating part of this game is rolling for echo substats. it's so stupid, you spend week farming for echoes with the desired main stat only to get garbage substats. It's ridiculous, you spend thousands of tuners and still get those garbage substats."
Greedy
"You promise us great things and then give us lackluster nothing for an anniversary. You only cater to people with money who are willing to pay 200 Euros for a character, while the majority, the f2p players get nothing for the anniversary. We deserve more than 20 pulls. Give us at least a free 5 Star, you've set the expectations high and deliver nothing. I hope you don't earn a single cent from this disappointing anniversary and you learn your lesson. Or better yet, you fix this now."
Very bad anniversary rewards
"Mid game, decent enough to kill some time with until better games come out. Not worth spending money on. managed to build a solid reputation with 2.0, then proceeded to absolutely ruin it with the shady and predatory Anniversary Event, killed all hype for this game's and studio's future."
Another greedy gacha game that doesn't respect its players. So poorly optimized also that you might not even be able to run it on your device.
unfortunately i can't give 0 star in case of ur trash anniversary event üôèüèª
Choosing to make anniversary prioritizing new player with money instead of their own fanbase who support them throughout the year. Holy Moly
Kuro plss make the optimize the graphics even i play at low graphics it cause a fps drop
great game for high performance device
horrible anniversary
need more graphic on mobile
"Hey devs, I really enjoy the game and would love to give it 5 stars, but performance on the S24 Ultra needs improvement. Frame drops during intense fights are unexpected. Please optimize for smoother gameplay and consider adding a 120fps option. Thanks!"
"Great storyü§© and awesome battle scenesüòè, well done!!üëçüèª"
noice
This is my first open world game.And I had a nice experience.i love this graphics and characters they build up.I need to tell that the story is really mind blowing. This is one of the best game I played in my life.thank you KURO for this masterpiece.
I used to love this game but the aniversary stream changed it the rewards are not good no free 5 star no flight in other regions altogether the 2.3 update is very disappointing
Thanks for the gut punch KUROüòí
Wow
"- update kuro anniversary reward is a mess ngl. please listen to the loyal players because imagine give more reward returning player and new player make your loyal player enjoy a reward that a decission to pull in 12 banners this not good becoming hoyo scam sadge. Best game Best devs dont be hoyo scam kuro, we Kuro bots and normal gamers will support your game aslong you listen to player base and also improved more to come to your game."
"presentasi di anniversary kali sangat sangatlah memuaskan, dari segi event baru, cerita baru, character baru semuanya sempurna. Kecuali satu hal, yaitu Hadiah anniversary nya. sangat sangat tidak adil untuk player lama yang bertahan dari awal rilis, dimana saat itu keadaan game sangat sangatlah kacau. banyak bug disana sini, dan masalah performa yang tak berujung. tetapi player player lama tetap setia bertahan dalam game. ini sangatlah tidak adil rasanya. semoga ini menjadi pertimbangan."
better character design
"this is the greatest gacha game with gretest devs,mods...."
"I can't believe the anniversary is so utterly disappointing , it almost feels like all their generosity and player satisfaction went away ... Releasing 2 +10 banners without making it easier in any way possible ... and barely compensating for the lost resources in the shortened version on 2.2 .... I'm done supporting this game and spending money on it , thank you for the nice time we had but showing your true colours after 1 year of your exiatance... That was a nice move , thank you Kuro."
w game only needs to be more battery efficient
"Graphics are good but not optimized, if you're planning to play it in mobile just forget it. I recommend playing it on pc with high specs. Event consumes too much of your time and some of it were really hard to accomplish and the rewards are not even worth it."
"Hey,Kuro Games.Can you make a cloud gaming service for Wuthering Waves as(base my experience with Hoyo games)I don't think my phone will ever enough stronge for running the game without log out itself or lagging hard Also, please don't make the time trial to low like Genshin Impact cloud gaming service"
"The 1st anni rewards are a greedy joke. Additionally, the fan service is really drastic which for many people, including me, it will seem disgusting. The designs of the characters are boring and look plain compared to their arts, the story is bad and boring because it's ruined by said fanservice. The only good things are the exploration ability and general vibe of the game, as the scenery is stunning. Terrible, would not recommend for non gacha players."
"One of the best ""Gacha"" game you can find out there."
"""W, this is so player friendly"" basically"
"Best open world, rpg. Really love it. The combat, the resonators, graphics, the story, the abilities everything is just perfect. Not saying I hate genshin or anything but for me Wuwa rates no. 1 of all gacha games I have played so far, and I'm a day 1 genshin player, trust me genshin does even come near wuwa. wuwa in on a whole another level. keep up the good work kuro, you got my support. Also for those who say Wuwa is bad, has nudity...shame on you people, this game is entertaining and fun."
"They're just the typical greedy gatcha company with predatory practices. New anniversary coming out that will make it impossible for f2p or even dolphins to get what they want vs a typical patch. They know that people will not have enough free currency to get the characters and FOMO will make more people pull out their wallets than not. Don't get sucked in, move on and find another game."
"I came back to this game after a year, hoping it has become smoother for lower-end devices. Unfortunately, it's still unoptimized for the most part. It's really hard to fight the enemies, especially when fighting bosses. It lags too much even when all graphics options are turned to low."
I only gave this game a 4 star because I can't re-watch the cutscenes. Kuro please enable this function just like you did it on pgr
Damn this game is so fun and amazing i played a lot of this type of games and I usually stop when my level is high but this.. damn I've been playing it for sometime now and this game never disappoints I don't get bored easily like some ususal...(I heard this game is getting mass reported don't worry I'll support this game! don't listen to em I hope this grows very nicely!)
"1 star for lackluster anniversary rewards, and the fluctuations on the ping and really ugly graphics even when I've a solid mid range phone"
Like all gacha games it is gambling. They want your money and will do everything they can to get you hooked but are very reluctant to reciprocate unless forced. That said the 2.0 patch onwards has been very good up to the 2.2 main story which has very good storytelling for such a short runtime. Multiple QoL enhancements and continuous optimization enabling play even on an old gaming laptop with an i7 8th and 1060 6GB bur smartphones will need much better hardware. Gamble responsibly.
Awesome üëå
"I don't know, I just love it!!!"
"Wow, what an amazing anniversary celebration! 110 pulls? Groundbreaking. That‚Äôs like‚Ä¶ 10 more than a regular patch‚Äîhow generous! Oh, and let‚Äôs not forget they conveniently cut 2.2 short, so those extra 10 pulls? Yeah, we basically would‚Äôve had them anyway. If you just remove the word 'anniversary' from the announcement, it‚Äôs literally just a normal patch. Nothing special, nothing celebratory. Truly a masterclass in bare minimum effort. Bravo, Kuro."
"The game has been consistently good for a while, but the recent update stream has soured any goodwill people have in regards to that. This signals that the game is heading towards more player-unfriendly practices in the future. Consider this before getting the game, and even more so if you intend to spend any money on it."
I love the game but it's so lag on me because I have low end device 64gb 4ram but it's playable love your game ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
terrible anniversary reward and a slap in the face for people who had faith in them
the main quest is too unbalanced I'm lv 29 but the enemy I should fight is above level 50 I can't even approach the enemy bruh
best game ever
"need more improvement in the combat camera , because we are unable to move the camera freely while fighting, and unable to hit the enemy,whom i prefer to kill first in combat , it's hard move camera to see the enemy I want , so I hope this problem will be solved as soon as possible , thanks you"
not good
Disappointing greedy game company with no respect for current players
"This game deserves goty, although i don't really enjoy the story. Would love to see cyberpunk themes in the future"
"This game is best for us i have been playing this since it was released, but let's jump into the main problem......im facing low ping and lagging since started playing even my mobile is good and have good wifi but still....... pls do something and bring new feature to set the game graphics even more low, thanks üåπ"
the is graphic is amazing and the design is phenomenal
suck games
why it's 12+ again -_- I want to play game where developer have freedom over it
I can't play and i can't even login to mag Google account
"cashgrab event as they first anniversary, no thx"
"The story, animation and contents just keep getting better and better. Just a bit of advice; consider adding at least 1 male resonator per patch, if not possible. Make it 1 male every two patch. We want some spice of bromance and/or ship sailing for female players. Thank you for you hard work, sincerelyüôè"
"Wuthering Waves is an absolutely stunning game! The graphics are breathtaking, the combat is fast-paced and satisfying, and the world feels rich with lore and exploration. I love the character designs and the soundtrack is top-tier‚Äîit really immerses you in the experience. It‚Äôs a great balance of story, action, and open-world adventure. Definitely a must-play for fans of anime-style ARPGs!"
Your most recent event is for whales who pay so much to keep your game ongoing
"This game will, make you believe they are not like every other gacha company only to spit in your face, when it matters most. Dont bother playing, the devs dont't respect you as a player."
"I once played this game before, and I decided to quit. Now that I was about to play again, once i tried to log in, it said ""Server Unavailable."" I tried to find a solution but i cannot, ill keep trying to log in. For now this is my rating. (sorry for my bad grammar)"
Exceptional visuals and gameplay Amazing story and Characters
"ok, i download this game because of scar, please make him playable and i comeback to change my review become a five star. please more male characters:"""
I like it but the clothes of women are crazy.. üò∞
I really love this game! Thank you for always improving the game!
more than 5 banner for anniversary but anniversary rewards are worst i spend all my astreties on s2 shorekeeper now i have nothing for anniversary
Meh Anniversary Reward and also worsen by Maygi a nice content creator being banned . Screw you Kuro.
Chanli my beloved ü©∑ü©∑
"Anniversary is absolutely abysmal, thank god I don't waste my money on this game and thank you kuro for reminding me why I shouldn't spend money if I ever felt like it"
I love this game so much ü´∂üèº‚ú®
Dogwater Anniversary event
"lol.watched their 1st anniversary ls,nothing special . just a normal ""patch 2.3-2.4"" . ""anniversary"" is just a bait word. cont with this pattern and u (kuro) will gain the ""fame"" in the internet."
1.0 story and voice acting was rough. the story picked up later on but it is still okish. Most of the characters are just waifu bait for the Rover. The game still needs a lot of work.
very bad aniversary rewards expected something better
A good game
Bad Anniversary Rewards
Best game even surpassed a lot of single player games
more better than genshin keep it up
Good
"disappointing anniversary, pretty sad was hoping for more"
exceptionalle
greedy game company
"Peak, I love this game"
best game ever frrrr i deleted all my games except for this all the story of the hm character is well written also the developer is so kind towards the player thats what they said love the players and they will love your game too truly one of kind
"Anniversary rewards, fix them"
"bad anniversary rewards compare to regular patch, at the end all gacha games will follow genshin path anyways, anniversary for player? No, its anniversary celebration for the dev instead."
1st anniversary sounds like a celebration...for the KURO CEO. Not for players. There are other games folks.
Absolutely shameful rewards for 1st year anniversary. Been playing since release and feel like my support of the game has not been acknowledged by the Dev. Will give a better score when the devs give better rewards for 1st anniversary.
Anniversary rewards are pathetic
The game style is so perfect and characters graphics are awesome. I love the storyline too. It's a great game to play.
Bad anniversary rewards üëéüèº
"This is an amazing game, but could you add more seating areas and maybe a way to replay cutscenes? The cutscenes are beautiful, and I'd prefer not having to record them, especially whenever I miss them."
Still the best.
really bad predatory game don't play
"The Anniversary, the censorship, and the swimsuit paid skins, it all sucks."
Greedy Company. Worst Anniversary.
Amazing story and fantastic gameplay but the worst 1 year anniversary! I'll change my review when we get a free limited 5 star...
"F2P friendly, 2.0 and up is top tier cinema. gameplay imo is very fun and rewards skill based play. MC is actually viable. But with its new found popularity it seems to going the Genshin route with having a very bad anniversary. I still recommend the game however start lowering all expectations for being rewarded for sticking with the game."
"Best Game so far, Because Combat style & 3 D character Smooth ü§ô"
absolutely the worst and Pathetic anniversary in the history of games
masterpiece
pretty good for me its better than genshin cause of the free rewards
pls kuro change the rewards at least give a free 5 star character pls
sorry kuro games for the anniversary think the this bad but it is very good
bad anniversary rewards
This game was having a thrill so many challeging quest
the best game in the year
very disappointed about their 1st anniversary.
Worst reward for a first anniversary. 1 star review incoming. Will change to 5 once im satisfied again
the game is One of the best f2p game I have ever played. but I'm a mobile player and this game mobile version is not well optimise always feels lagy .....plz optimize this for mobile player ‚úÖ
Fix your anniversary.
useless anniversary
"As a day 1 player. I've spent money on this game & I am willing to spend to show my appreciation. But with the anniversary announcement, which is a great opportunity to introduce new players, they introduced 10 banners of past characters, which is called ANNIVERSARY BANNER, but it has 80 pity and is not guaranteed. You have a 50% chance of not getting what you want in anniversary, crazy. As a day 1 player, it just feels like I've just been spat in the face by them, if patch goes thru I'm leaving"
awesome games
seriously?
1st anniversary gifts are joke.
l loves wuthering wave graphics and character design
"Don't let these incels going to make this wonderful game being rated 1, Wuthering Waves is good as it is."
se necesita la opci√≥n de predescarga en m√≥viles kuro porfavor es horrible tener que descargar todo el contenido de nuevo..
This is such a good game with a more f2p and responsive developer team. It has a much better fighting style than genshin but it lacks in story. It deserves to be much more popular.
I love this game so much
"waste of money, wont spend anymore, dissapointed in anniverssary, you are the same as genshin"
dropped to 2* cause of the greed Kuro decided that they want to give presents for the anniversary of the game to only rich people
"I absolutely love the game they asked what we wanted in characters, and they are delivering!!"
coming back 1 year(shorekeeper )and rerunning only for 11 days .. and the next banner is zani .. nice one kuro... isn't it like the mavuika and citlali banner together?
anniversary rewards are disappointing
love the combat
terrible anniversary rewards after supporting the game through it's rough launch... but no hermano that 12 character banner is definitely player friendly
the first anni truly a disappointment. not even a single 4* free unit.. slowly turning greedy and becoming like hoyo. Many reward for newbie but none for veteran. ABSOLUTELY PERMENANT 3*. ruin the trust of the community u guys already built. L move
I'm really disappointed with the anniversary rewards. Not expected that from Kuro games üòî. Overall it's a really good game.
anniversary rewards are not good not f2p friendly pls give us a at least 1 free 5 star or reduce and confirm the pity of anniversary banner+ give some more pulls
Very little to zero appreciation towards players who stayed from the rough start of the game towards the current patch. Don't give money towards developers who treat people like consumers instead of customers.
"I hope for more male characters kuro, please. So far any aspects were pleasantly satisfied"
"mobile optimization is still laggy, and the 1st anniversary event is disappointing"
L anniversary. LMFAO
"Not often do I write a 1 star review while not being angry. but here I am, not angry, but disspointed and upset. new player here, only got into the fame a couple weeks ago, and the anni has killed my drive to play. not even as a protest or anything, I just don't feel motivated to boot it up for even login rewards, all the good will I once had towards Kuro for P:GR and the turnaround they managed with 2.0 is hollow now, it leaves all my gaming tainted and bittersweet at best."
Gameplay and fighting style is way better then genshin impact
worst anniversary gift ever
after 2.0 the optimize problem is pretty much gone and the story is absolutely banger
I'm downloading ts for the edgerunners collab
L Anniversary
2.3 livestream was bad..lack of rewards im 2.3 is such a downfall.Kuro game this is such a let down after 2.2
"The revolutionary game , developers are so good that they put the money all in game and quality of life . the graphics are insane ."
"The most disappointing anniversary reward I've ever seen in any gacha game.Kuro dev team is something else.With 2.2's god tier story line and amazing characters the game exploded in popularity and revenue skyrocketed.But instead of celebrating the fans who's been playing the game for a year all the events and rewards are made for either whales or new players.23 free pulls,2x paid skin each costs 30$,not even a free standard 5 star selector but instead 50/50 event banner.Thishowyoutreatyourfans?"
i don't know if this is good but i only download it because of the trailerüòè
I wish you guys keep the same energy (review bomb) like in the genshin 1st anniversary comes in Hypocrite lol
"First they started censoring already released characters. Now they announce the anniversary that even worse than regular patches in rewards. Honestly, i never expected devs to fall so low withing a time frame of a few weeks."
This game is awesome
awful anniversary
"Was 5 star, after the anniversary, it is disrespectful towards their players. Corporate greed & record profits for investors OVER player satisfaction. makes me sick"
"Not sure what went through your decision process, but since you thought this was worth it, here take your one star."
"we deserve a better anniversary gift, you gave out a free 5 star before, why not now?"
"Horrendous if you're a returning player, a lot of fomo on relevant events like free characters and horrible anniversary rewards. Just a repeat of what another company has done, save your money."
give better anniversary rewards ffs what is this?genshin?
"this has been the most funnest action and adventure game I've ever played, the characters are very interesting with their designs. The voice acting and the weapons that are made with each character having their own type of attack abilities. very good background stories, very well thought out plot and story build up with the character Rover. I've been playing this game since it came out and I'm looking forward to see what other things Kuro comes up with next. Wuwa is AWESOME."
"5 stars for me, all the way. One thing I have to say though is that it'll be great if you can optimise the game performance in mobile as well, it isn't bad as of now but it can still be better"
bad anniversary rewards
DOGSHIT ANNIVERSARY REWARDS
Its been a real disappointment to see the first year anniversary rewards of WuWa so lackluster. I have played Genshin up till their first year anniversary as well and I am one that is not easily affected by the sunk cost fallacy; I quit immediately because I know my self worth and time. I supported WuWa because I truly believe that this game will treat their players right by celebrating TOGETHER with us.
Kuro went full Hoyo. You never go full Hoyo. Character censorship after they were released and purchased followed by a horrendously greedy 1st anniversary reveal. Way to go Kuro you became everything players loath.
the dev got greedy and stupid
"you were supposed to be one destroy them, not join them. will change my review later after kuro stop being greedy"
The anniversary rewards are a slap in the face for longtime players.
1st anniversary is an abomination. 10 reruns and 2 new characters. Here are all the characters you can't get unless you spend a lot of money!
Greedy devs.
"YOUR GAME NEED OPTIMIZATION. NO APPEALS TO THE GAMER, JUST PLAY ANOTHER MMORPG."
why anniversary lack reward for players who support this game since 1.0
Greedy developers just ruins what's for the most part a good game
PEAK STORYLINE PEAK CHARACTERS PEAK EVERYTHING I LOVE THIS GAME!! 1000000/10 AMD THE CHARACTERS ARE JUST SO üòçüòçü§≠ü§≠ü§≠ü§≠ü§≠
"it's so God damn fun, very recommended"
Horibble anniversary
They became Genshin Impact 2
"joke of an anniversary, they took all the genshin comparisons to heart and said let's make our anniversary as bad as their worst one years ago."
"I have never thought i'd be changing my 5 star review to this but here we are, please kuro don't follow the trend of others gachas and make the anniversary rewards better for everyone's sake."
Stupid Anniversary Reward
No Free 5* character in the Anniversary
i like the graphic of this game prefer to play it on PC it has more better graphic and not heating my phone üòÜ
"Insert ""W, this is so player friendly"" meme here"
better anniversary rewards
"ha yeah bro 10 pulls and 10 reruns to encourage money spending!! very interesting anniversary Kuro games ü§ëü§ëüíµüí∞üí∞, idc since i play and understand gacha games but i feel sad for the NEWCOMERS players that had their HOPES very high and got crushed in a single stream. IT'S A GACHA GAME, it's not an ordinary genre of game."
Game lon
qu√© triste... solo sab√©is hacer mujeres altas que peguen pu√±etazos en cinem√°ticas igual que mihoyo... decepcionante
with the 2.3 livestream announcing their rewards for 2.3 that is underwhelming.. considering their reputation for being generous in rewards and listening to player feedback.. they actually ruined my trust. its like their slowly becoming those predatory gacha games from hoyoverse.. their anniversary 12 banners are not even f2p friendly the astrites you can get are just like their ordinary patches . what a pity Kuro games i still believe you can turn things around. until then this is my rating
Bad anniversary be more generous
"5 to 1 star, so this is what wuthering waves can give to their player base on the ANNIVERSARY? 12 banners? for who? for those who can spend? for whales? Especially after the rerun of SK the only must pull in the game, too greedy. so disappointed. and when will you add the 3 resonator icon for switching in android ios?"
Patch 2.3 review. Interesting content. Not enough rewards for an anniversary patch.
"It's surprising to see a gacha game company that listens to the players by releasing a lot of questionnaires (type characters we expect to see more, weapons that needs to be added, etc.). The combat just kept getting more & more unique & fun to play. The character designs & exploration also improved. All this happened in a short amount of time. As for the story, I think it will take a few more versions to get me SUPER invested but it did get better, I didn't skip one dialogue"
true colours shown
"Awful anniversary gifts, feel like a fool for spending money on this game. They bait you with generosity when feeling like players are about to leave, then when it's fime to celebrate they give you more opportunities to spend money and nothing else. Shameful"
"0 aniversary rewards, when genshin do this we put 2stars in the Google play let's do this with wuthering too"
"Perfect, Version 2.2 made the game even better, Better storytelling, Deeper lore, Better Music, New area, Cool gravity adjustment Mechanic, and the 2.2 story quest is just Absolute cinema, Worth the update, and Anniversary is next patch so Happy Birthday Wuthering Waves"
"for the 1st anniversary., you need to step up for game. We are the ones who fund you! make it better. be better"
bad anniversary
"I have stayed with the game from day1, through high and low believing in the team to do better. In the end its all the same, good until the game is stable, then comes the enshittification."
"The rerun banners are incredibly predatory 10 rerun at once is uncalled for and should never be a thing unless you are ready to compensate by lowering the pull cost, pity, etc. Make them guaranteed or give one for free. Doesn't feel like an anniversary patch at all. Great normal patch tho"
terrible
definitely fell in love with this game after 2.2 version üíï‚ú®
semakin lag di versi terbaru
just mediocre
"Terrible launch but they showed promise of improving the game, which they were doing. Then the anniversary stream dropped and they made the fumble of the century. All they had to do was one-up hoyoverse by being more generous (which is a low bar to surpass) but instead they doubled down by having 12 banners with no improvements to drop rates or any increase in pull income. Do not play this game and if you already do, drop it."
Great game but i really dont understand why devs are ruining WuWa hype train. Anniversary patches should feel for players. Im reading this patch notes and there is a 10x pull that i wont get because im not a returnee. There is another 10x pull i cant even use for the character i want because of timegate. There is no new map etc. That means even with anniversary rewards i will get the regular amount. What was the point of all that 1st anni teaser? I dont feel rewarded for supporting this game.
"game play and graphics are sub par, rate is pretty bad and gems are expensive"
"Hey, so... Please change the anniversary rewards. They are absolute trash, and I can't believe you guys became predatory so effing fast. It's disappointing."
I don't play the game but my friends said that anniversary rewards are bad so...
"Wuwa has been great up to this point, but Kuro decided to see how far they can take things with the anniversary rewards now that the game has become more popular. A shame, but it goes to show that no company should be trusted, no matter how much they try to build up trust with the playerbase. Eventually they will attempt to cash that trust in."
most disappointing anniversary patch ever. rerunning 12 characters with no real way to get anyone of them without spending a fortune. it feels like kurogames are rewarding themselves with this patch.
1st anni üòÇ
Was a good run for the first year but with this anniversary there showing how greedy they are
"Although the game gets bombarded because of the lack of anniversary rewards, i still think that the anniv rewards may improve later on future anniversaries. Keep up the good work."
terrible anniversary
*sigh* here we go again... happy anniversary!
"The best open world gacha game, best waifu in gacha games all time(Changli), best combat in gacha games, guaranteed weapon, has skip button and easy traversing in world, But anniversary rewards sucked no free 5 star :( ..."
very bad anniversary
Atleast be a little respectful and tactful with your greed kuro.
Devs take female players for granted and I'm not wanting to play a wifu game. After seeing we were no longer getting male characters to pull and then this anniversary seems so lack luster I think I'm out.
"Happy 1st anniversary, 1 star review for dissapointing anni rewards and banners. looking foward to uninstall the game. Thanks."
"Played the game since launch, sunk money into the game because i thought Kuro had earned it with the experience they provided. Now with the upcoming 2.3 update they've spat in the face of the the player base and become another cash grab gatcha that doesn't care about its players. Oh yeah, free skin for the wings that are region locked and nobody wanted."
"1, Dev anniversary ‚úîÔ∏è Player anniversary ‚ùå. 2,""Player friendly"" Lol. 3, New players or returning players get more rewards than old players is playing every day. 4,It is the same amount of pulls. Remember 2.2 is cut short for this patch, and that is where you get those extra ""free"" 20 pulls from. So overall, you get nothing really if you added in the missing 20 days if it was a full 45 days 2.2 patch cycle. 5, The live anniversary is bad then Genshin"
love this game!!!!
Bad anni rewards. Genshin style behavior
bad anniversary
"garbage anniversary, devs are rewarding themselves instead of a celebrity for the players."
Just here to leave feedback on anniversary rewards. Not only am I disappointed but Kuro needs to recognize how important this is for their reputation. Especially now that all eyes are on the game
"Unfortunately Kuro is proving to be predatory as other companies. I do believe that the weapon banner is great on this game, however putting 12 characters under 50/50 banners was not the greatest move. It appears that greed is increasing on this company as well. Hope I can change my review soon."
"Worst anniversary and the prizes are stingy. We are very disappointed, Kuro Gamesüíîüòû"
Some anniversary huh
"I do have a problem which I find frustrating at times. I use Huawei Nova 5T when playing and it can handle the game just fine, going around between 40-60 fps. But everytime there is an update, it somehow drops to 10-20 fps and it makes the game a little unplayable and less enjoyable. Also, whenever I turn my volume up or down, my frames somehow gets back up to 40-60 fps but only for a split second before going back to 10 fps. But luckily, after the next update it goes back to normal."
"wuthering 1st anniversary are a big disappointment, following hoyo steps nice kuro games."
"Well, there is a lot to say but I'll be keeping this short. 2.3 is a total failure. Just 10 pulls more than an average patch. There is nothing special with the anniversary. I am not going to support devs until they properly care about their players. No rewards for me, no money for devs. Thats it."
"after the ""anniversary"" stream I am very disappointed with Kuro. turns out they are your money grubbin greedy company no different than hoyoverse and other greedy companies."
"1st anniversary does not respect the players enough to give adequate rewards for 1 entire year of support. Though the ups and downs, this coming patch is not it. We received better rewards in 1.2, this is unacceptable."
masterpiece!
"The game is no longer playable in my Redmi K40 Gaming phone. Even in the lowest graphic settings I still get significant frame drops which ruins the experience. As much as I want to keep on playing this on my mobile, I find it hard to complete the most recent update due to these performance issues. I hope you're still optimizing this game for lower end phones. But for now I'll give it a 2."
"kuro is going down hill, making some choices even their competitors knew were bad"
Really bad anniversary event more like a normal patch slammed with anni all over.
üíî
sir I am fall in love with game better than genshin impact but previouslly the character design changes I don't like it ü•πü•≤ we want back degin of characters ü•≤ü•π
the anniversary is qn absolute disappointment.
Anniversary convene is absolutely predatory
"Anniversary rewards really disappointed me. Now it will be waste of time to play this for f2p player like me because it took lots time to farm astrite and pull the favourite characters even you did that but you will loose the 50/50. Now I am gonna delete this game, there will be no fun to play without my favourite character that I've wanted for a long time."
KURO IS BEING STINGY and DISRESPECT PLAYERS who support the games. They just want to milk PLAYERS like HOYOVERSE on Anniversary Patch instead of rewarding player for the huge support since launch. 37 Free pulls but 12 banners with same BS 50/50 and 80-pity? NO SIGNIFICANT change to the game??? I have played Wuwa since launch even though there were bunch of bugs and glitches. I have spent near 700 USD in Wuwa and PGR collectively and Yall treat me like that. Very Disappointed.
Whale friendly anniversary.
L anniv reward shows you don't care about community.
anniversary has too many banners and few known claimable asterites on anniversary patch to even get one.
disappointing anniversary
they all are the same
worst anniversary rewards and 12 banner with no extra pull this to much greedy
Trash Anniversary Rewards
absolute cinema game
top tier gacha game
anni is bad
"really kuro? 12+? why not 16? dumb kids shouldn't be playing a game that has a gambling mechanism, almost incentive. keep it to 16 or you'll lose player base (edit:anniversary rewards has been hoyofied)"
Anniversary rewards suck
"Everything was going so well up until the recent censorship patch they did. They finally addressed the censorship, but I'm still disappointed. I hope this won't affect their future characters. I really want more beautiful and seductive characters in the future. Furthermore, the recent anniversary was also very disappointing. There was a lack of rewards and I'm not satisfied with the amount we're getting at all. I hope Kuro listens to the players' feedback regarding censorship and rewards."
"it's crazy that Kuro dropped the ball on what should have been an easy win for anniversary, especially with how they have been steadily growing income on the gacha spending charts. crazy that we have to hurt google classroom's review score because of this"
"Devs are becoming too greedy and stingy since their competition is greedy too. Better anniv rewards would be appreciated. But for now, no."
awful anniversary rewards. doesn't care about the community
just better
beautiful game it's a work of art
disappointing anniversary rewards.
trash 1st anniversary.
Bad optimization
Genshin 1st anniversary in Wuwa form.
I want more anniversary rewards atleast a free standard 5 star
Disappointed üëéüèª
"what with the anniversary rewards it's like the normal patch what's special about it, utterly disappointing"
I can't believe they are so greedy. I thought they were trustworthy? but no they aren't. I guess kuro became a genshin Impact 2.0üòîüòî
"you fumble the anniversary,yall fr wanna become hoyoverseüíîüíî"
Almost Genshin level anniversary...
I'm sad you didn't live up to my expectations üö∂üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏èüíî
"Very good game Edit: this is the final nail in the coffin, bye bye wuwa"
"Give players more rewards, you are giving the same ammount of pulls that would be in a normal patch, but in an anniversary patch"
the voice acting is a bit limited.. I know there's room for improvement apart from that I find the art style really amazing yeah really good game üëç
decreased rating. games is showing signs of p2w. Will stop while ahead.
nice ‚ú®ü§´cyberpunk collab
Very predatory 12 banners in anniversary with just free 30 pulls. Lol .
"Update: The anniversary rewards are severely lacking after they already decided to shorten the previous patch. Greedy devs think an ""anniversary reward"" is giving the players more opportunities to spend money. Combat is amazing, story has become stale and predictable. A lot of flash and no substance. And the characters rarely ever interact with each other, only the main protagonist rover."
sabse bekar or ghatiya game üò°üò°
why no five star wuwa why
good
cool game
This game really out did every gacha games that I ever played. When its first release I thought it would be the same generic gacha game but now every major update gives a new sense and experience. The developer never lets down their players; they listen. I am satisfied with the progress they are making. It is a pretty solid game and I hope they continue what they are doing.
worst anniversary rewards
bad anniversary
"The disappointment is crazy. 1. No free 5 star. 2. Not even a standard 5-star. 3. Flight still not available in all regions. 4. Paid skins. 5. Predatory banners (NOT EVEN 100% rate up). Sure Kuro, it is definitely ""Player Friendly"", great job taking lessons from HSR devs. Feels like a celebration for them rather than the players."
fix the rewards kuro. stop being greedy
Just take 1 star for now. You know what to do lol
game baik. Beneranü•∞
"Absolutely the worst anniversary I've seen in a gacha game in a long while: The rewards are lackluster, no free anniversary 5 star selector or even a 100% guarantee on the Anniversary character banners at the very least. Still got the normal 50/50 usual rates. Not even big spenders don't wanna spend. Only dumb people will defend this choice. Even Genshin gave a free 5 star anniversary selector, and Mihoyo's known for being among the greediest gacha devs. This is NOT it Kuro."
"i like how you celebrate your anniversary by selling us more stuff instead of celebrating old players. also on phone, this game stutters quite a bit so sticking with pc for now"
Horrible anniversary if you can call it that. Burnt any good will you built up
Terrible 1 year anniversary stream. Absolute nothing. Not to mention Canterella changes. Different from other games? what a joke. disappointed.
"L Anniv, a lot of re run banner with only 30 free pull and no free character"
Lame reward system. Worse than GI
Semangat terus developer dalam optimalisasi game kedepannya üòä ( edit : kalau bisa dan memungkinkan agar untuk dioptimalkan agar mulus dimain kan di perangkat low end seperti mediatek G96 )
"Seems like the game is getting greedier and greedier. Barely any 4 stars, always pandering to waifu gooners, and now the anniversary ""rewards"" are just a huge cash grab. Sad to see a promising game die on this pathetic hill."
"Good visual and design, most importantly not kikir hehe"
wuthering waves more like wuthering whales
"I WANT BETTER ANIVERSARY REWARDS!!!! GIVE ME A FREE 5 LIMITED STAR CHARACTER WITH WEAPON, IS IT SO HARD?? I AM GRINDING THIS GAME FOR 1 YEAR NOW AND THIS IS WHAT I GET IN ANIVERSARY????"
no free 5 star on anniversary
harem simulator at this point don't expect too much from this game it is indeed fun
"Running 12 characters in a single patch, all with 50/50 drop chance after pity. Fomo on a whole new level. An absolute joke, this game is up there with the worst of them on greed."
L Anniversary
"Kurolistened stealed 15 limited pulls from 2.2 patch and give them in 2.3 like anniversary reward. Besides this, anniversary looking even more for whale than hsr anni, that's crazy I'm not even ftp and feel very disappointed. Maybe I need to stop playing gacha games xd"
i love this game but they are taking A massive L super greedy with this anni not changing my review until they change it
i love it
worst anniversary ever
"the lag and frame drop is causing a lot of people to uninstall the game, the cause for all of this is the lack of servers in most regions, u might have a high end device but still experience lag because of the high ping, I hope all they to fix this issue and I will reinstall the game"
Great game with great potential. But there is still much to improve. The game still feels clanky with some unnatural movement. And the transactions should be much more fluid .
very well appreciate game
very greedy and bad anniversary do better
"Censorship sucks, anniversary reward sucks even more, Kuro is trying to sell us skins that can get stealth change overnight"
Best gacha game of all time!
so much predatory system
"People are upset because they didn‚Äôt get a free 5-star character during the anniversary, all because they believed the leaker. Well, who told them to trust leaks in the first place?"
"The 2.3 livestream was such a let down. Predatory banners aimed at forcing people to spend. The event banners aren't even guaranteed, and if you lose you get standard banner characters. At least getting the other limited characters on the event when you lose 50/50 would be fine, this is just so greedy."
prototypical predatory gacha garbage
"really why? I thought anniversary to be decent but the rewards are just so middddd!!!!! Don't get me wrong, it's a good patch but for anniversary, Why Kuro games why is it so mid!? It's should have been better than 25 pulls but not even guaranteed 5 stars banner. I'm not even saying free 5 stars....Come on guys why let down our expectations....I know you can do better than this üôè"
"You call these your anniversary rewards?? You already cut this patch by 2 weeks and prevented us to get more resources, now you bomb us with 12 banners and give us 10 wishes to make up for it??? Selfish and Greedy!!"
"I just watched the Livestream and I was very disappointed. Isn't this supposed to be an anniversary for the game? then why is it that a random patch gets a free 5 star limited character while the anniversary sucks. Also, I was expecting to get more rewards since the duration for 2.2 patch is short but turns out you guys just want to put it in your anniversary reward so it seems much more compared to other patches."
"Huge push towards monetization with the anniversary update. Instead of an Anniversary event, it looks like a spending event."
Absolutely predatory banners for Patch 2.3
No anniversary rewards. This game is only for whales
The 1st anniversary for this game is atrocious. Anniversary banners 2 phases 10 characters all with 50/50 chance on top of 2 brand characters. Way to celebrate yourselves and not your players just disappointing.
loved the game. then the 1st anniversary announcements dropped....Won't be changing my rating to be more positive till something changes.
"piss poor anniversary rewards. 10 rerun banners all at once where you are not even guaranteed the character, plus 2 new 5 star characters. paid skins. no new 4 star character announcement. no rover skin. but hey, at least you get free wing skin. üëçüèª greedy!!"
happy anniv
disappointing anniversary for its 1st one
no free 5 star in anniversary
another company consumed by greed lmao
not satisfied with the anniversary livestream for 2.3... It feels like a regular patch but with more rerun banners... Why does the anniversary rerun banners have a 50-50? Why hold back on the rewards all of a sudden? Zani's banner is gonna sell and you know it...
"REALLY? I JUST PULLED CHIANGLI LAST MONTH BECAUSE I LIKE HER, AND NOW I WANT SHOREKEEPER TOO BUT I COULDN'T GET HER BECAUSE I LOST THE 50/50, AND THEN NOW THEY'RE RERUNNING CHIANGLI AGAIN?! IF I HAD KNOWN SOONER, I COULD'VE JUST PULLED SHOREKEEPER FIRST BEFOE CHIANGLI, NOW THE ANNIVERSARY IS NOT ENOUGH TO COMPENSATE IT, I WANT SHOREKEEPER BUT I CAN'T, I'M DONE WITH THIS SHT!"
"all im asking for is anni reruns with 100% guarantee/lower pity or another free 5* standard as a day 1 player, idk how devs will get back goodwill from the rest of them tho"
Man you guys did everything right 2.2 was banger. How did you guys fumble the ani
You changed the theme music and I hate it. I loved the old one..
"W, this is so player-friendly"
L 1ST ANNIVERSARY
"Disappointing anniversary, do better"
Anniversary rewards are so bad for the amount of characters and weapons that are rerunning maybe atleast give us an amount that could guarantee one
"game is beautiful and all but seriously? player friendly when there's about to be 12 banners in one patch? the free pulls is great but making it a 50/50 on the anniversary banner is just outrageous, the least you could do is guarantee the selected 5 star. I'm not complaining about there being no free character, but with 12 damn banners it sure would be nice to get at least one character guaranteed."
"I'm disappointed kuro, you can do better kuro games, 20 pulls for 10 banners..."
"My initial rating would've been 4/5 due to great gameplay and characters, with downsides being echos and 50/50 system. However, I am extremely disappointed with the upcoming anniversary. Cramping 10 rerun banners (with 50/50 btw) together with popular limited characters while not even providing enough pulls to get any 5-star, not even a limited char? I'm angry at how they phrase this as ""player-friendly"" when this is the most predatory anniversary yet. It's not that hard to give good rewards..."
really great game i downloaded it at My other phone
Better rewards for aniversary.
bad anniversary rewards
What even are these anni rewards.... Dissapointed
"I missed free Xiangli Yao, coz I started playing later in the game. Why don't they give it free again? I thought they would give a free Xiangli Yao for free as the first anniversary reward, but why Kuro, why? Why did you do tthis to me?üò≠ I'm so disappointed now, you could do better than just 20 free pulls Kuro, I had high hopes from you. I might just quit, coz this isn't just worth it. I want a free Xiangli Yao. Where is my free Xiangli Yao, Kuro? Give me free Xiangli Yao, this is so unfairüò≠üò≠"
Disappointed
nice aniversary!! learning from hoyo now are we?
bad anniversary
I hope they optimize the game that the mobile player got the best gameplay experience :)
the more than disappointing anniversary rewards show no gratitude towards their player base whatsoever.
really bad anniversary rewards
Trash anniversary
L anniversary reward. 1st anniversary is so disappointing 20 pull same as other gotcha game with many rerun and same kind of event. you guys getting greedy . such a sad reality. be better kuro.
Stingy Anniversary
wasted potential another hoyo
"First, Chinese censorship, and then the worst anniversary rewards any game has ever given to its players for a year of support"
"Honestly, really liked the game and thought Kuro games was different. But they decided that they wanted to put a middle finger up with that anniversary."
"The games graphics are gorgeous, the characters attacks and skills are all unique and well designed, and the devs sincerely care about the game and us palyers - fixing bugs, giving out plenty of rewards, listening to player feedback. I've never regretted playing this game, and I don't ever expect to - though the anniversary..."
Good and impressive game
"I was a pre-registered player with this game and I am really sad at how the characters are doing right. Instead of having cool characters we get fanservice. Kuro, I really love the game. Please don't ruin it."
"Dropped from 5* to 1*. Anniversary is meant to be special, not slapping your fans in the face. Don't play this greedy game."
"Somehow, they made the anniversary worse than any of the other big gacha games. This is sad."
Hey koru community you've been ignoring my texts and not fixing the bugs on mobile it's hard for me and other mobile users to do quests or even have fun in the game due to more updates which causes more lag cause it's not balanced in mobile so pls fix it it's been months and you kept ignoring my text and I just wanna have fun I was a big pgr fan and I wanted to play this so pls ü•∫
actual trash on the anniversary 20 pulls for 12 banners with a 50/50 chance to lose is embarrassing do better.
"The devs are generous, gameplay is great, and the story is cinematic. No need to further in more ‚úãüòêü§ö"
Greedy
"Withering Waves is one of the more predatory gacha games of its kind. There is bare minimum free currency, no real free characters, and banner timers are so short they only give you enough time to pump money into it if you're desperate not to miss out. Rewards for things they offer like the battle pass feel they have so little impact that there's no point. I basically have can hope to get 1 character out of every 6 they showcase. I don't have the money. Other games do it better."
"i supported u, connoseur from the start, and here u gave us in return...."
"crashes too much, insane fan service üòüüòü"
honestly I am so disappointed by the anniversary rewards
üëå
the anniversary rewards need to change. we pretty much got nothing because of how this current patch ends early
horrible anniversary rewards!!
W Anniversary
"Anniversary? more like regular patch with a lot of rerun banners! Fix this ""Anniversary"" please"
trash anniversary event. you should have made the selection banner guaranteed. kuro is a greedy company
Everything was fine until you started putting a lot of disgusting and eye-watering fanservice.üëé
dogshit anniversary reward
players friendly ahh game
"This is such a ""Player-friendly"" game"
"This game is so good and so Manny efforts so, Keep hard working, that's all."
Kuro please fix the anniversary reward stuff
disappointing anniversary
Disappointing 1st anniversary rewards. Became more stingy once you had that genshin money.
"L Anniversary patch. Just a cash grab with 12 rerun banners. Aside from the few more events, it's basically a filler patch."
"For the first wuwa anniversary we get the privilege to spend our money on two new banners and ten reruns, wow!"
Wuwa is a very interesting game. You have to try..
Awful anniversary rewards
"Kuro, i love your game but you need to add more men. The lack of male characters in this game is really insulting, it shows you don't care about women. If you don't add more, I'm definitely going to stop playing. 4/19 edit the anniversary rewards were abysmal."
cus what the hell were those anniversary rewards?!! not even genshin would give them
POOR FIRST ANNIVERSARY REWARDS LOL
"Came back to edit my review. The game tanked so hard with its anniversary rewards. I don't feel valued as a player. The game still has issues with lag here and there, ping issues and so many other things."
gacha system is very difficult
"game is good but I'll give 1 star because I've been losing the 50/50 ever since the start of the game...this pisses me off so much(literally just maxed encore ressonance chain today because of that) P.S: this is the worst anniversary we could ask for, are they really aiming for the hoyoverse route?"
tf is that anniversary
very good combat and graphics though the problem is u lean on more of an fan service which is dissapointing cuz I was hoping u would create this game to make people fun but I guess u made it too much fun for them to the point u would create a char to be more sexually appealing just to grab extra cash
I love kuro
Terrible rewards for a 1st anniversary!!! This company is greedy af
"Wuthering Waves operation teams is something else, With the 2.2 updates, god-tier storyline, the game's popularity exploded. But instead of capitalizing on this hype for the annyversary celebration they just dumped a bucket of cold water on it. Seriously, nice job. Why skimp on the rewards? Thats some real comedy."
you know the rules and so do i
best game i ever played in mobile the story gameplay and music is just banger
good
The 1st anniversary livestream is very lackluster. The reward is just a regular patch update with 10 more pulls or more? And they did it along with 10 rerun banners of great characters and 2 characters that is loved by players plus skins. Like they aim to milk the players dry of their wallet. I truly love this game and even spent a bit even though I spent rarely in games but if this is how they treat their players then even I won't tolerate this. This is truly disappointing from Kuro.
Great job with the anniversary. Devs will surely enjoy it.
Kuro games was looking like they were going to be the good guys of gacha but to be honest after the 2.3 livestream I don't want to play this game anymore
trash anniversary rewards
first anniversary and we get 20 pull locked in 2nd phase. is it anniversary or filler patch make up your mind
A player-friendly review for the game's anniversary
Very disappointed with the anniversary rewards
trash anniversaries
"Really bad anniversary patch. Lack of rewards aside, there's nothing that makes the 2.3 update special. Same pity system on all banners, same events, same login bonuses, same everything. 2.0 was better and grander in scope to this. A major step back after such a good run in 2025."
Really disappointed üòû
"i know kuro, but you gotta be actual ""player friendly"""
1st Anniversary of the game is a regular patch. Greed is starting to get to them. Worried about the future for Kuro.
The game itself isnt fully optimized for mobile and the CEO is very greedy about the anniversary. No generosity whatsoever. On top of that its clear that it's gonna be yet another Waifu bait games. Very dissapointed
best game
waiting for real anniv events
A big disappointment. The anniversary is a disappointment. We hope that you will issue an official apology and offer more prizes.
Following the footsteps of HOYO with the shittiest anniversary. Your downfall is inevitable.
dogwater anniversary rewards
u should give your players more rewards in The 1st Anniversary cuz they're THE ONLY REASON U SUCCESS
"fix the rewards, we want free character and much more rewards, you were much better than this, give love to your players, we also want free T5 character selector, Jiyan, Yinlin, Zhezhi, Xiangli yao and Shorekeeper."
First anniversary rewards are too niche. looms like Tencent having stakes and people on board is affecting the generosity of devs.
"You can pet the dog. 10/10 game of the year edit: most disappointing anniversary for a game. no free 5* character? guaranteed pull? yikes. changing this from 5* to 1* (i want to change it to 0* since they have 0 care to give for the players, but sadly can't do that)"
1st anniversary rewards are a joke
Best gacha
"I'm mainly a PC player, but kinda unexpected that this game also runs so well in my 8 Elite phone, if I have to nitpick I hope devs can add 8E to their optimization targets as right now the game is warning me to lower the settings down even if the chip can easily handle the game. I also hope they can reduce the loading of objects in long distances. ""Getting greedy like Hoyo, nope enough of that."""
BAD BIRTHDAY
"Photo mode not saving photo and screen record doesn't record any sound at all, been a while and it's still not fixed yet. 3 star for now until u guy's fix it"
Disappointing anniversary man
predatory game with paid gambling mechanics to obtain characters. Any game with paid gambling mechanics should be 18+ in rating. The anniversary rewards are trash.
"Alright, horrid anniversary announcement, let's wait for 2.4 to change my review"
first disappointment from 1st anniversary
"THEY DROPPED THE BAR WITH THE NEW UPDATE!! REALLY BAD REWARDS, NOT F2P FRIENDLY!!"
Censorship is always bad. Terrible 1st anniversary rewards.
Do better for aniv
awful anniversary rewards
anniversary sucks
How much time will you take guys to resolve this lag and fps issue?
"Update April 9, 2025 : Awful anniversary, could have been better. Let's not copy GenShit Midpact greediness pls..."
Mid Anniversary
"Horrible anniversary stream, 30 summons on ANNIVERSARY seems like a joke, stop been greedy"
kuro could never. terrible anniversary rewards.
not the same company anymore. kuro tasted success and is now just as greedy as many other gachas like genshin impact. cant recommend after the dissapointing anniversary rewards. 12 banners you have to use premium summons for and still can lose 50/50 on and they are giving less pulls than their normal patch updates. nothing free for anniversary and 50/50 losses to look forward to trying for a previous character you want and no reduction in pity. star rail was more generous. lame
"lame anniversary reward, big L"
"No Free limited 5* or new, Bad Anni, Cancelling lunite sub"
it game is so good for boy üåö
"Updating my review: Day 1 player here, the rewards for the 1st anniversary are extremely disappointing considering the history of the game. No 5 star selector, 10 banners but still 50/50 chance, very little will be given even though the massive banner is coming up. A standard patch gave out more in some cases that the anniversary, seems like Kuro is starting to take the Hoyo strat. please don't fumble the ball Kuro, be better."
"don't like the fanservice? cry about it lmao, go back to your kiddie games. game lagging? get a new phone u poor fk how is that their fault, u can't expect to play a game of this quality with a 2014 phone smh"
Why did you think that the amount of rewards in this anniversary is appropriate and proportionate to the number of banners released.
Characters censored with ugly rushed shorts to maintain 12+ rating to hook kids into gambling. Horrible anniversary rewards as well.
cool game
What an abysmal anniversary.
"Kuro becoming greedy like hoyo: - bad anni rewards. - release 10 banners just to entice players to spend money. - flight system still not available in a lot of regions, despite player feedback."
"do not play this game, it's very predatory"
Not worthy of being played.
garbage anniversary
Terrible anniversary event.
tencent get in your shoe's now kuro? quite disappointed
GARBAGE ANNIVERSARY REWARDS EVEN STARRAIL IS BETTER TRASH GAME
L Anniversary. Generational Fumble.
"Stingey anniversary rewards, wasted a hour and a half of my life"
amazing game
Worst game ever. zani 4* animation. bad universary. baby events. why changli and ü•ï skins not in 2.3. zani animation trash. she deserves better. genshin better ( meh not really just angry)
I had vertigo after playing this game
"gooner game, i got jiyan then got bored, im done with the game, nice gonner game bro"
"Nice 1st anniversary event. Really whale-friendly. They just stated that they would be as greedy as Mihoyo, so good riddance. If you consider playing this game, beware: this is all about getting your money, like always with gacha games. So i just changed my rating from 5 stars to 1"
sigh one year anni was disappointing
No free 5* for anniversary
Devs are taking lessons from HSR and becoming greedy.
bad game
money hungry game
They got greedy with the anniversary
50/50 wins or 1 star
TERRIBLE ANNIVERSARY REWARDS. GIVE ME MY FREE LIMITED 5 STAR NOW
no free 5 star it is ok but atleast some more pulls and make the banner atleast guaranteed for the first time pls I believe in you wuwa
after that anniversary? really disappointed at you kuro
I LOVE ZANI YES YES
"I'm soo diassappointed with 1st anniversary gifts we're expected a gratitude from Kuro/WutheringWaves team by giving a Free 5* star resonator banner but now hearts r broken because of u guys, I'm Broken üíî"
Best game ever.
"please fix the physics and the designs, it is just a headache"
worst 1st eneversery ever
Kinda Disappointed with Anniversary Rewards....No free 5 star???why so greedy
the game was 10/10 before but they really fumbled the aniversary. no free standard selector really in 2025. even Hoya was better
"Even though games of this type ARE predatory, they intensified it moreso with the upcoming anniversary. Gacha games should be investigated by commerce agencies globally."
"What a trash anniversary actually abysmal, no one cares about the cubes and it's such low effort too, just because you got some recognition you become greedy"
they became greedy like there counterparts so one star for the anniversary announcement.
I just got shorekeeper in a 1 pull!!!!
"Ahora si tenemos un problema, el aniversario es decepcionante, si no cambian nada va a ser un duro golpe para el juego, creo que estan intentando ver cual es el limite de los jugadores y eso no es bueno."
"It became extremely clear that kuro is also going down the same path as genshin with their anniversary reward announcement. Disappointed, extremely disappointed."
Extremely predatory anniversary (read player friendly)
"1st anniversary news are bad so far. They went the greedy route. Wanna get a 5 star you missed during it, well open your wallet and pray to rng."
"2.3 Anniversary Banners are pure greed, the anniversary banners themselves with the selector still has the horrible 50/50 pity system."
"L anniversary patch tbh, expected better from Kuro"
"Such a mid anniversary live stream no free 5 resonator even hsr gave a free 5 star, 10 reruns with 50/50, only 20 pulls and acting like they gave us so much, yeah trash greedy company."
best gacha game and exploration game ever and the reward are peakkkkkk
"Nice thx for giving 12 banners with 50/50 on anniversary and calling yourself ""PLAYERFRIENDLY"" You guys have proved yourself you are another money hungry company"
The first anniversary rewards are a joke.
"Anniversary reward just tiny bit better than normal patch .. damn man xD we became hoyo now huh, time to move on I guess"
very bad anniversary rewards
üëé
The game's anniversary and yet there is no free character.
L anniv
I don't know why but when I exit from game my account is going to level one and the is restart from beginning
Nah those anniversary rewards ain't it. I thought you was different Kuro.
the game always crashes whenever I play for a few minutes.It never happened before and only started recently.I hope that you can fix this problem Kuro games.And also it takes so long to compile shaders
Yup Greedy Game.
"If you guys playing on Samsung, please download the game via Samsung Store instead. The game there is more optimized for your samsung device."
well that was a FLOPversary!
trash game
"Trash 1st anniversary reward, going down the hoyo trash road, sad to see it, sad to see jt"
L anniversary
"HAPPYYYY 1ST ANNIVERSARY WUWA‚ùóHOPING FOR THE GAMES SUCCESS ‚ùóWOOOHHH!! THANK YOU FOR EVERYTHING, SPECIALLY FOR CREATING WUTHERING WAVES!!! HBD WUWA!! PROUD PLAYER SINCE 1.0"
"thrash, wish could give zero or negative stars, advise people to stay away from such predatory games"
"up until an hour ago I'd say it is a game that deserves 4 star, if not 4. but they just showed us they are even more greedier than hoyogames and it's saying A LOT. 10 reruns in one patch, 2 new characters and not guarantee, plus not a single good anni rewards, good going kuro"
greedy ahh company
horrible anniversary. absolutely garbage. now your greed is showing
"NO 5* SELECTOR IN ANIVERSARY, BOOO."
where selector
Disappointing Anniversary Rewards.
GIVE US MORE MALE CHARACTERS!!!
Great game. 10/10.
Most generous gacha game ever. W DEV. We love u ‚ù§
"game tidak ramah, gada *5 gratis di anniv, sedangkan imlek dpt XY gratis"
greedy game
this good game
"high ping, unavailable to play even with 200+ Mbps speed."
"Honestly, I love Wuthering Waves. Kuro Games has been putting a lot of effort into the game, each character is really well-written, and the story is progressing smoothly. They‚Äôre making the game rewarding so that f2p players aren‚Äôt left out. With every update, Wuthering Waves becomes more optimized for devices. The combat is amazing, and the world is absolutely beautiful."
Basically THE BEST
wonderful game
I love Wuthering Waves
"more optimizations needed, to minimize fps drops. It would be great if the update for the next patch would be similar to Genshin Impact where you only need to download the additional content, downloading 17Gb seems little and short to countries with strong Mbps but not all has that level of internet speed."
it's good
one of the best games ever played by me
gooner game lots of kids playing this sensitive characters body ewww ü§¢
nice
qualityüëå
please make it 16+ again it was good before
phenomenal game
What a beautiful amazing gane love it
best
good üíØüíØ
the game is kinda clunky for me...
Worst Game Worst Worst Game Ever I've seen in my life fix Lag Problem first then I will play
THE BEST AND MOST EPIC CINEMATIC GAME EVER! ITS WORTH EVERY SECOND!
great experience overall good but the giggle physics need to be decreased so it's a 4.5 for me
"AMAZING GAME! Arts are awesome, theme songs are awesome. This is a very enjoyable game! I love playing with my Jinhsi!"
mamah baizin~~ nghhh~~~
Best gacha game ever!!!
"one of the if not the best gacha game out right now, especially with the 2.2 update, the game just became absolute peak."
amazing graphics and storyline
nice game
w game ngl
"I have been playing this game ever since it's released, I think we all know that the game had a bad start with the voicelines, bugs, lags, etc. As time goes by, the game is getting better, improving so fast. For the style and aesthetics, the models and animations are so cool and unique, although the character designs have more room to improve. The open-world, personally, it looks apocalyptic, still I love every bit of the view through the wilderness. The mechanics make the game fun."
"The game is great, both characters and regions are beautiful but it is more convenient if the characters had a bit more censorship."
"Well cinematic animated and well developed storyline , just masterpiece and greatest ever created game"
I LOVE IT
Great Game.
i absolutely Love this game and I know that it has a lot of potential to become one of the best games but there's a main issue I have while playing on my phone. It's none other than the game crashing after a few minutes of gameplay. My phone model is a realme note 50. Plz fix this so I can keep playing without having to reset the game a couple of times thx.
"a really fun game, the combat and exploration tools they give are honestly so fire and make the game more fun. plus if your looking at the ratings trying to see about the cantarella and scar and geshu lin backlash its fake, please look into it and you'll see and the leaker who gave that info was known to be unreliable with his posts"
Very good animation and love the fighting style. The cut scenes are a treat to watch. There is so much to explore and the main story is definitely worth the time. I would really recommend trying this game.
"The gameplay feels like it's only saving grace. The story feels like an isekai. The mc feels like a Mary Sue, and everything revolves around the mc, literally. We have characters that are walking encyclopedias that are engineered to treat the rover like a messiah at every waking moment. Nothing felt earned to garner their trust. Game was advertised with a look on nature & characters reclaim back some pocket of humanity for themselves in a post-apocalyptic world, but it feels the exact opposite"
STUCK AT LOGIN
Good
"if i can rate 100 stars i will, what makes it a great game is because the dev really listen, the dev really prioritizing players comfort when playing the game. In result players having a lot of fun playing the game, not to mention the generosity from the dev giving the players a lot of gacha/ingame currency (astrite) from event or simply exploring so the players didn't stress out. I can write an essay of how amazing the game & the dev is. Thankyou to everyone making this game."
I love monster
truly a masterpiece
"one of the best games out there !! i really love their company so much, they treat the players so well, feeding us like babies. we love you, kuro „ÉΩ(*¬¥ÔºæÔΩÄ)Ôæâ"
master copy of genshin üòÇüòÇüòÇ
Jeeezzz mntp
great game been a fan of kuro since pgr but if you're gonna get this game I recommend you have a decent phone that can handle the game and that you have the storage space I played on mobile but switched to PC and it's 10x better on PC since it can handle it
"Replayed the game after taking a break for several months, reprise of tide event didn't trigger."
"this game is truly amazing and a feast to the eyes. sadly, I don't think I can play this for much longer, as my phone is beginning to struggle while processing the visual graphics of this game. Maybe if they added a more lowered resolution mode for the mobile port of the game I'd be able to play without issues"
Been waiting along time for this and today the day has finally arrived and it is gonna be legendary. I see all the negative feed back the game is getting but just chill and be patient these devs and support and kuro are the G.O.A.T.S and I will continue to spend money and support this game for as long as it is going. absolute cinema best gacha game ever by far good job kuro gladly support this game.
what can i say amazing game
Why can't i log in due loading failed
its great
genshin impact but BETTER!!! 10/10
"Please optimize for Android : After 2.1 it's getting crash even at lowest setting possible, so my guess is that it needs more optimization for Samsung devices. Before, it only used to crash during fights but now after 2.2 it is crashing randomly."
f this game never won a single 50/50 lost to changli and shorekeeper twice and extreme hard pity literally 75+
this game make me feel free
good
great
"Keeps on saying NETWORK ERROR!! Did so many steps, chat on discord no help at all!"
Best game in my life I have ever played
fun
it's a good game I thought these new version that shorekeeper gonna di* luckily she's saved kinda disappointed actually cuz this is not kuro that I knowüóø
"devs listen, no power creep, great story, great game to invest in."
best game for me
it good
No Censorship
make this game 16+ there is no need to the kids to play who ain't eligible yet to play this game and whoever are reporting it they themselves doesn't want this game to be on the top cuz their favorite one isn't. Pls the developers of wuwa please optimize the game make it 16+ again wait not 16 make it 18+ ...
Thank you for accompanying and comforting me when I was alone.
this game is very interesting üíØüíØüíØ
Great stoy with tons of fun stuff . It's a good game for adventure openworld rpg lovers.
it's a fun game but on mobile it crashes constantly and sometimes won't even let the game open
"this is a disgusting game that fetishes woman, I thought this would be a good game that's different from all of the other oversexulized gacha games. turns out I'm wrong :/ really disappointed"
ok ok game
heard the Game had nudityü§∑üèæ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è
i love this game
best gacha out there
Still expecting more masterpiece works. Keep up the good work Kuro‚úåÔ∏è‚ú®
Good game
this is best but not like pubg i love both game üòä
damn I like it
masterpiece
"Great story, very good gameplay, very good graphics is very fun to play"
"Better than GI imo, but I still love GI. ZANI please come home"
I hope I could play this game one day‚úä
"Amazing! Oh my god. The gameplay, cinematics, and the characters are very well-thought."
"very nice game, quality and graphics are impressive"
please add indonesian subtitle
this game is good
experience outstanding
nice
Amazing gameplay and characters
good
"It is a very fun game overall! Amazing graphics, story, characters, and voice acting. But teleporting is a pain because the game freezes mid-loading. It makes my experience quite cumbersome and also means that I have to leave the game and log back in to even play the game after teleporting. That is my only problem with the game right now and fixing this would help a ton!"
"I would rate it 4,5 stars if it was possible. I wanna try a max setting one but it's so laggy and overheated (my storage has about 180gb left) , otherwise it's the best game I have ever played . good characters, good qualities and friendly fandom. I hope the next update may improve and optimize more someday . btw I lost 50/50 in Shorekeeper banner twice üò≠"
don't worry it's almost pay to win.you can f2p and still enjoy it unlike other gacha games
"assalamualaikum kuro, saya berada disini untuk menyampaikan sepatah dua kata. Bagi saya menang rate off yeü•∞"
üò≠üò≠‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è j'aime beaucoup
little short like story but game strong
"my phone can't handle the game even with the lowest settings üòí I tried my best playing it even tho it crashes every now and then but I have enough. I try any possible thing but yep this game is not for all android phone players üòë welp, goodluck and goodbye"
"I've been a player since release. I love everything about the game and even in the future I would defend WuWa from any toxic people calling it a gooner game. I absolutely love the story and the characters, I hope the new nation after Rinascita would be amazing and would have many male characters (still love the fem chars). I look forward to the improvement of Kuro :3"
"one of the best games I've ever played. combat beats the typical open world slow combat with a fresh experience of fast action. it promotes skill-based gameplay, and character farming is one of the most manageable aspects of grinding. gacha is one of the most F2p friendliest ones, and it'll be way better if the 50/50 is removed. cinematography wise, the best with moderate level of talking. overall 10/10, a game I actually enjoyed far longer than other titles."
"Best and most fun open world game with beautiful and handsome characters. Beautiful, artistic fighting animation I couldn't ask better. I hope we can get more adult male characters in the future!"
"good game, btw please make new character with another culture appereance"
People complaining about female fan service are the same ones who would be on their knees crying in joy if WuWa ever decides to release a shirtless guy. This games amazing
enjoy and stable game...kuro game also always care about player
"currently ul73, still enjoying this game so far"
"breathtaking blend of stylish combat, emotional storytelling, and stunning world design. It‚Äôs not just a game it‚Äôs an experience that resonates."
"The mobile experience is ok but could be better still lags from time to time need better server optimization for better ping. But average, I'll give u. do something so more devices can play on mobile and optimise the server so people in other region can have a smooth experience"
best gacha in market no compering
"The only five star rating I'll ever give a gacha. Excellent landscapes, travel made easy, fast loading times, fun and challenging combat system, musical masterpiece, perfect main character, engaging storyline, the list goes on. They're listening to their community and it shows. Lost my 50 on Carlotta, I'll be waiting for her return. Love you guys, and praying for a Hoyo backruptcy. Great work, #1 in my book. Thanks"
I like it
Great experience
"Everything about this game is beautiful and fun, and I deeply appreciate the devs for doing their best to improve the game and most of all, attentive to the player's concerns and suggestions. I do hope the issue where my mid range phone would lag a lot can be fixed. in the earlier versions the game runs smoothly in my phone, overtime after updates it overheats easily and lags. the settings also indicate that my phone is overclocked even when all my graphic setting are set to low. Please fix this"
LOVE IT VERYYYY MUCHHHH!!! keep up the work Kuro and Solon Lee! I support you guys!!
last time i said it's soo laggy and i have it like 3 stars but man the kuro Dev's are just type of guys I never seen in any other games like they literally soo generous and the way they take their surveys so seriously to improve game is absolutely best thing and every patch making game more beautiful and story is amazing keep it up kuroüî•üî•üî•üî•
"Really grateful, better than genshin"
"I love how mostly every npc is interactable, this gives the game more content and something we can really enjoy."
great game one of the most f2P friendly game and the devs are good they always listen to the community and act as the community wants and i think is the best gacha game ryt now
"Thank you, Kuro, for listening to your players all this time. But I have a suggestion for you to add a feature to delete old resources. That's all and thanks. Don't forget to take a rest."
very nice to play
Good graphics and fun to play I all ways play with my friends and sister we love it
super game
"Changing my rating to 3 star, because I can't get Shore keeper even if I pulled 95 times"
"One of the best gacha games I've ever played. As a casual player and quite the busy person with school and stuff, this game is the only one that I can still manage. The exploration is not hard but also not easy, so it's a balance. The events are fun and challenging to do. But by far, the stories and lore of this game is what really attracts me, the rollercoaster of emotions when playing through. That rush to find out the ending. And the occasional plot twist. BEST GAME OF ALL TIME"
"Been playing since launch, devs listen to their players. love the game."
AMAZING !
This is a game that is actually worth your time. Developers listen to feedback and will most likely fix problems as soon as possible. You also don't need to worry about power creep because this is as much as it is a skill based game and less as a gacha game.
"17 GB was worth that update this next installment not only continues to match the same tones as previous stories, I've never had A game or series hit me consecutively A good emotional narrative. not to mention the game is fun as Hell. and there's only A slight elemental mechanic that mostly matters at higher level fights. it has the same stamina threshold problems as other gachas, but I've so far had little to no problem building what characters I want and painting my stamina for when I build."
"Great game, and devs care about their game and hear players feedback"
please give us new male healer support..
Best game hands down. 100/10
"imstantly changing the appearance of the character without even notifying the players is the most blunder move this game have ever done its really a great game but got fall to the trap of the community who mass report this game even though its not even the player who play this game and the game even follow them, now i think this is the first time im gonna witness a game thats gonna get destroyed"
"Game first, Gacha second. Respects your time."
too laggy and irritates my gamplay expe
One of the best Open World anime style game.
2.2 story : absolute cinema ‚úãüòûü§ö
kuro is so generous i don't regret playing his game.. i love so much this game thank you kuro
best
nice
Good Game! keep it up
game is great
very fun and exciting game
"The developers are responsive, implement changes based on the surveys and other consumer suggested improvements. The game is incredible not only maintaining playability of initial 1.0 characters but making the content less about having the current banner character and more about gameplay mechanics and team composition. 100% recommend to give it a try especially with the anniverwary being just around the corner."
this game is awesome i liked it but my phone was so heated
"This game is really doing well and great with all those QOL changes üòÅ.:Currently I have Two problems:- 1) Character diversity - there is not much male units as much as female, I love female resonators but still it's lack that diversity which Kuro Team said to provide.üò† 2) Graphics: new colour system is Amazing but there still some way too sharpy line and blurry in characters. There's a problem with overheating which leads to lagging and it's happens under 10 minutes of playing which is bad."
Better than any open worlds game
this game is great but the boss is really hard bruh i cant even beat the boss the boss will healing herself i cant even beat bruh
"my first open world i'll even played and its the best, even though characters are not many each one has a unique and i loved it especially Camellya ü´°üòÅüòÅ"
Fun
"male rover's character design is weird, he looks like a Kpop Idol wanabe, the female rover looks awesome, she looks like a kunoichi of somesort"
Its very nice but its lagging pls fix it and bring Camila back pls
.So far so good. Will be back when I have played a bit more. Futuristico is the key here ;)
From what I played in PC it has good combat better than any gacha game so far. And the number 1 best gacha game until Arknights Endfield comes out then 2nd best. But overall it needs to have better optimization on a lower spec's PC's and phones.
Absolute Cinema
"the best mobile game ever, genshin get out"
SHOREKEEPER!!!!!!
i like the game but my phone doesn't support lol
üòí well bad gacha system
I love you kurogames ‚ù§‚ù§‚ù§
"I love the game but I was betrayed. I invested so much currency, poured a lot of effort into my Cantarella and then they decided to alter her design after I bought her. That demotivated me to love their game. I hope Kuro Games revert the censorship"
Awesome game.
The best game i have ever played. Thanks for this wonderful experience of the game. Thanks.
its totally perfect now. trust me you will enjoy this game ü•∞
Absolute Game
would love to see game optimization on lower end device
such outstanding graphics and game story telling
not bad
best
"I love you for always listening to your community WuWa. Thank you Kuro devs, thank you."
the graffices sakes
I have free space but your say not
worst game I've ever played on mobile.......the game itself is good but it's literally unplayable on mobile. it crashes every 2 minutes and this issue isn't just from me all my friends who tried it also had this issue.please don't try this game unless you have a crazy good device
The game is awesome
AWESOME GAME!!! KEEP IT UP!!
please optimize the game for mobile it has tons of lags and crashes and fps drops.
It's a pretty good game!
DAMN
Optimization is extremely pure on Galaxy S24.
mantap
can you guys make my luck better? i just lost 4 times in a row already
"One of the BEST games I have played.. Big Thumbs Up.. Highly recommended for those like to play open world adventure,gacha type game,great story line for each playable character, awesome cutscenes for main story and exciting mini games and quest.. Keep up the great work Kuro.. easily 5 stars"
good game
love the game character design I'd amazing so is combat I don't play on mobile but when I do it's very bad and laggy for those mobile players
how the hell this game is just 12+ with all that wifuu stuffs
SUPER UNOPTIMIZED. Would rate it NEGATIVE if I could. How do you even make a MOBILE GAME and NOT MAKE IT WORK PROPERLY?? Some high-action mobile game you have here.
thank you for r2 cantarella + weapon in under 150 pulls
"Blows Genshin and other games like it out of the park. Keep up the good work, Kuro Games!"
perfect game
"This game really shows care to their players as they fix things and give so much rewards for the satisfaction of players. I love this game also the developers for their hardwork they exert to this game and so far, the story and character is good as well as the exploration edited: the fan service in this game is insane, will never install this game again!"
Great Game. Give some Birthday Gifts for individual players please. Also the option to change from Male<>Female Rover with some time limit would be nice.
I was just unlucky. So I deleted my account a day after I started playing it!
"I'm very disappointed, this is such a cool game to play and I loved this game. Until the news of Wuthering waves, might possibly stop releasing more male characters. As a female player, I really am disappointed."
so sadd my 1 month of grinding for shorekeeper become calcharo
"Boring, and you have to go to hard pity every time if you want a new character."
a top contender if you're looking for a genuinely good quality free to play story game. overall worth it for the already kind gacha system alone
game NI sgt bagus Dan keren
best experience
The game is too good to be true with all the rewards kuro gives. It has very nice graphics and the character designs are so nice .It runs smooth pc rather on phone .For better experience one would have to play in much nicer device .Thankssssssssssssss kuroooo for such a nice game.
good
just amazing
Best Game And Still Here Grinding Now A 4 Accounts at my potato phone that lag and the audio gets distorted every time I dodge enemy attack
i dont know if anyone noticed but 50/50 dosent have equal chance like most of players lose 70 percent of times that shows game is getting p2w they should fix the 50/50 i lost like 10 times and won only 3 times in 2 account
"just got shorekeeper, now my teambuilding is gonna be easyyyyyyy"
Love it
Again more minor detail changes and ratings changed again. Played us like a fiddle.
best gacha game ever and the devs listen to its players!!!!!
i love wuthering waves!!!!!! üó£Ô∏èüí•üî•
Game has censorship.
"Ever since last minor update i think around a week ago, the game become very trash, keep force close when i tried to open the app, and once i able to open the game, the controller won't work even though my controller is working just fine. Now even just to play the game are very hell difficult to login in my devicesüò°"
"Thank you very much for such incredible job! As a PS5 user, I love this game so much. I have fun all day just exploring and listening to the amazing compositions. The 2.0 main quest until now it's been a masterpiece. I fall in love each time with the character. I'm sorry guys but big KUDOS for Kuro Games. Amazing job! ‚ù£Ô∏è"
"I honestly can't even play the game. The story and characters are well made... but I can't even do anything without my game constantly crashing! I deleted most of my apps just to install Wuwa, but I can't even go thru a cutscene without my game crashing!"
ez shorekeeper
thank you kuro!!!!
I LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCHHHHHHH
"this game has become something actually amazing. a questionable start with 1.0, but is now arguably at its best with 2.2. kuro keeps improving with every update and i do not expect them to stop any time soon"
"I'm so disappointed. The direction of this game is taking a turn and it feels like a harem-oriented game now. Please be reminded that not all players are there for the 'waifus' or whatever gooning materials y'all are making. The post-apocalypse vibes are gone too and it completely became a fantasy game like genshin impact. I downloaded this game for scar, so seeing how the game is doing right now is just so straight up disappointing. If this game was made for incels, Then say it."
"Such an amazing game, played the beta and looking forward to the official release! Currently in version 2.2 and the game just keeps improving. Keep it up Kuro!"
"helloo, I'm wuthering waves fanss and i play on pc, would like to suggest adding Indonesian subtitles. I'm not very fluent in English so I hope you see my suggestion and make it happen."
"This is THE Best gacha game I have ever played, like this is the only gacha game that pulled me and got me addicted to gacha industry of gaming, story is top notch and characters are well designed and the animations and fight styles are just so amazing and unique, I never had a problem with wuthering waves in terms of raging or insufficient amount of necessities for f2p players, its very well balanced and the developers are very very Generousüíï unlike some other devs (hoyo) of other gacha games"
"Wuthering Waves has stolen my heart with its immersive world and engaging mechanics. very generous with rewards and great exploration experience. the only problem i have would be only to add a claim all button on achivement and other events, but it's not a big deal, but it would be nice to have."
"very good game. but pls can you fix the crash on itel a70, I can't open it so I play on fun pass,.sana mapansinüíØüòÄ"
well the game is really really good but the problem is the Helio g88 it couldn't handle the game It is always lagging and I can't even play properly and yeah I only give 1 star
Best Mobile game ever (i love you kuro‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è)
GAME BAIK ILYSM WuWa!
"the games is so good, is better than genshin impact since the the game has more dash and you can run up walls and its kinda fun"
I really like WuWa.
Just name it waifu simulator atp
soo apik game üéÆ
i disappointed so bad kuro for shorekeeper. is a really rate up? why so hard pity?
worst game i don't like your game is pathetic event i don't like it
Best game
its so good I just love it you should try it
one word. AMAZING üòç!
I love developer
"Kuro betrayed its core audience with mid-banner character edits and weak censorship to please clout-chasers who‚Äôll uninstall in a week. Characters mattered visuals first, gameplay second. Keep this up Kuro and you'll lose your real player base. The damage is done, and now players will hesitate to pull for new banners. Remember who kept you alive."
Damnn
The new event is really frustrating. The boss HP is so high even if I nuke it It only get small amount of HP. Please fix it.
Good
Please fix the login authorization bug ty
add bow and arrow character and special toll (character) like genshin impact (the girl with umbrella etc ) I know you have cameliya but add more add romance add option of dating
too much fan service....
WAY BETTER THAN GENSHIN
best game ever
genshin but better in every aspect
lmao the best game and the best Devs
"my current phone cant run this game. tho, i can play it on laptop and pc. The point is, i cant play it anywhere. The game is really great and devs are doing their best to improve the game, plus, its still 1 year which is an achievement itself. if i where to point it out the problem... i think they should add the lowest quality for those potato phone and laptop can run the game a bit smoothly."
"Overall is great, graphics, mechanics, characters etc. But the event gameplay is way too hard. The latest event is harder than i expected, harder than the Tower of Adversity. Even my Carlotta that has 71/290 crits, only deal 50k dmg on the lv100 boss. Feel unhappy with it."
The best game ever. that game could never lol. LONG LIVE KURO!
"First of all, I want to thank the devs (KuroGames) for making this marvelous game and having the opportunity to listen to us players. Even though it's hard for Kuro to make the game more playable, Kuro still listens to us. Moreover, for those ""haters"" & ""t0xic"" who scattered misinformation about the characters and design that doesn't have any source, y'all are FATUOUS, especially these hoyo players raging about nothing.ü•Ä Y'all stay being rambunctious‚Äîyou'll be humbled."
THISSSW ISS GOOD ( as an old genshin impact player) AN ABSOLUTE CINEMA .... Needs a LOT of optimization tho
"nice gacha, very good story. absolutely love the graphics üëå"
"it's good, the devs listen to the committee and the game has nice bosses, but I don't see any new 4 star characters and all, and for mobile the app overheats the phone but it's still good either way"
absolute cinema the best gacha game ever
"It has engaging gameplay, engaging cutscenes, and engaging maps"
Too Many Censorship
"Simply put, amazing. I wish I had started playing way before!"
"I just started recently and I like it a lot. As a player of other RPG games, the best thing I like is having all the voice dubs being lip-synched (even in JP audio). World traversal is awesome, very flexible and user-friendly. Battles are great and challenging. Stories are very good, not too long and are very interactive making the plot not boring. Animation and music are perfect, especially for me who is an anime fan."
"I love this game so much and it would be a 5 star but for the past few months it's been constantly lagging, crashing and freezing so much, it's getting really hard to enjoy the game now and I hope they fix it cuz it didn't use to be like this"
Amazing
The best gacha game be frr
the best game ever
Nice gameplay
"What kind of game is this kuro? Since shorekeeper first banner I lost every 5050... And now, I lost once again for shorekeeper's rerun... I'm going to quit now, my luck in this game's been affecting my mental health and now it worsen everything. Atleast you should try making it like genshins where there's capturing radiance, not for me but for those players that will still play this game.. My defeat today is the trigger that ill quit the game."
The game is great but tf is this details on the new character üò≠
game ini gachanya baik hati
Absolute cinemaüôå
cool
it's the first I got double 5 stars
"love it, and love how they listen to the players!"
"I have been playing the game for a month, the gameplay is good and the storyline is also the best, the unique character design is what captivated me, the creator is also generous, like sending free draws for you in the mail, and giving away good free characters, so the best game I've played so far"
good game
"In my opinion ,wuthering waves is the game that I being waiting for to play in mobile because I don't have a pc to play with it when the game released early in gacha. And now the game has released in mobile now i feel very happy. But I just wishing kuro can fix the lagging issue in sea server because the problem was make me became harder to enjoying the game. I hope this problem will be fix. Because I loves this game so much the characters design, combat moving , and the storylines.üò≠üò≠üò≠"
Absolutely Cinema
lama banget sumpah ngeluarin zani doang
"I think the game is really cool and fun, but there's only one thing that bothers. The co-op/friend chat can be really complicated and annoying. Sometimes, it cuts out 1 letter or character from a sentence, or it brings you to the top of the conversation even when you are supposed to be below the recent messages. 1 star off isn't overreacting. It really sucks that it's so difficult to communicate with others,especially in co-op, which is one of the things I like the like the most about the game."
This game listens to their players. Unlike the other game. 5 star for that. Over the top graphics.
"I'm not reporting for any bugs or etc, if only PGR and Wuthering waves are connected by the lore it'd be amazing"
"This game is amazing and the graphics of this game are also amazing and beautiful. I like this game's main stories too, It never disappoints me and I like that thing that they focus on the MC too just like a real anime MC ."
free 5* that's rare on 1 pity
"""I'm conflicted in my review of Wuthering Waves. While the game boasts solid gameplay mechanics, the recent updates have introduced a significant issue: the outfit choices for female characters are excessively revealing and out of keeping with the game's previous style. This is a major detractor and warrants a critical assessment from the developers."""
"edited: absolute cinema, to hell with censorship and absurdly and comedically sexualised female characters but name any anime style gacha game that haven't sexualising their female, some Devs just don't even care if they skirt the line from simple anime gacha to literally ecchi fanservice. what's left for Wuthering Waves is enable player to fodder their +0 equipment so they don't just gather dust in their bags and it's 10/10"
I really wanted to see how WUWA how can they simply mixed the sea quest in deep like navigating through deep of the most profound ocean..the others high resolution graphics game have already mixed this features full land and sea hopefully WUWA too.. I looking forward to that.! REALLY WANNA SEE THEM TO SWIM OUR CHARACTERS INTO DEEPEST ABYSS.. the frustration turn into 1 star.. yes indeed you made for sea mission but they cannot simply play or control for swimming.
"I strongly advise against spending money on this game. They can change the character design you paid for without warning, completely disregarding player trust. It‚Äôs unacceptable to invest in a character only to have its appearance altered later. If you value your money and your choices as a player, think twice before supporting this kind of practice. R16 to R12"
absolute cinema

"kuro pls release new male characters üò≠,the game is rlly good but we lsck male characters sm"
crazy how you guys removed Scars' onigiri dhit and proceeded to literally put coochi line on Cantarella üíÄüíÄüíÄ
"As a day 1 player, This game's just geting better and better. They always cook and listen, u can easily play around ur favourite character without getting POWERCREEPED. How crazy is that!? MC and the other 4 stars are still great till this day."
why my acc like trolling reroll??that's how u treat ur comeback player?
"The moment it started to mainly cater towards it's male audience everything went downhill. Going from the lack of male characters to the werid harem that's going on, this game stopped being pleasant. So many females characters with so much potential are being reduced to fanservice and it's killing me, not to mention the unecesaaey jiggle physics. They, in fact, do not move as if they're water"
It's a good game with good quality and the storyline is great just a bit laggy and keeps kicking me out but generally it's a good game.
üëç
So much better
The best Open world game without a doubt!
üëç
Better than genshin impact by far. Respects my time as a player and actually has a fun gameplay
Very nice game u can't believe u playing on mobile.. The character design are just top notch.
üî•
awesome zaher game
"i LOVED the game, ig the bills were just too high for them"
Wuthering waves is become an amazing it's continuous to improve this and I love this gameplay character and story all a fact thanks and I hope this game will go far
"well anyway its rated 12+ again now no hope for removing the censorship, great game anyway"
you know some games leave an impression when they constantly improve something that this game has done is understand the player base and what they need
"it's a great game , i know this is too early to judge so see how much better will be this game and also my personal option in case of gacha system, reward system, battle combat and story passing it's better than genshin impact definitely üëç"
the combat is so good..the dev is listening to their fan base..the exploration is good..the map is beautiful.. the characters design and combat is nice love the hard challenge..keep going kuro I will support you
Kinda disappointed. I hope y'all turn out to be better üíî
"really great action game actually, the lagging problem has been fix and all. Really supportive dev, always fixing the game and improving it and the most important is they listen to the community"
"One of if not the best Games I've played. Story is what you expect from a Gacha game but 0 fluff, straight to the point. Amazing combat second to none. Kuro is cooking."
wished we can use all 3 rovers at the same time
Better than Genshit ...full stop.
"nice graphics but too much sexy women. üòî I thought wuwa would be more better than genshin, well I guess.. don't put high expectations on Chinese game. Ngl, mobile legends (also Chinese company) are more better when designing their characters.."
masterpiece
Dialogue fest
Improve mobile optimization pls ;((
incredible cutscene
it listens to their fanbase
I've been a fan of the game since launch. You guys had a Rocky start but your continued drive to make the game the best it can be is a inspiration. I appreciate that y'all listen to feed back unlike some game that should not be mentioned. I hope you continue to take feed back and continue to optimize the game. One such update is maybe a Qol where the flying is allowed in all region. another one is maybe echo optimization. keep up the good work y'all.
good üëç
"the story line just feels really dry, and it's not that engaging imo. I have a hard time getting attached to the characters because they seem very one dimensional. I see a lot of potential for the game, but I'm really disappointed on how the story is going since it just feels like a boring dating sim for male players :/ sexualization of female characters is too much now... gross. if u're looking for a good game with actual substance, this game's not it. definition of wasted potential ü§ßüíÄ"
awesome graphics but need to be more optimize
"Best gacha game currently, good rewards, best weapon banner, best devs, chefs kiss."
"Edit: they fixed most of the lag issues! It gives a rich gameplay experience with fun and challenging puzzles, awesome real time combat and engaging new mechanics."
Best Game I ever played absolute cinema
I LOVE YOU THIS GAME üòòüòòü•∞ü•∞
cool game
wow
The best open world game to-date! So generous of the gifts too! R2- Still my most favourite game and thanks for the lot of quality of life improvements implemented in the game. Version 2.0 was a massive success with the Version 2.2 Main story quest ending with an absolute cinema story. You will always have our back Kuro Games! don't let those negative players from other games bring you down!
terima kasih dho sedekah
I played since launch 1.0 and this game maybe have a rough start. Always been compared to the rival company but Kuro proof they listen and learned from the player base. Honestly I'm just casual gamer in a phone but i got genuine feeling to root for this game to keep pushing. Blessed and keep it going on
"It's a really fun game ,like it doesn't stress you out when u try to play:)"
best gacha game üóø
my storage is Crying but worth every GBüòá
thank you very much
"This is a AAA quality, gacha second game. One of the best game developers ever. F2P is totally fine, but if you do spend money, you know the money is going right back into game development instead of some hoyo nuclear station lol. (btw, I love hoyo too but I'm just stating a fact)."
"Good game , better than genshin Impact.But improve the story"
good game
"Bad Optimation, hope the game will get better Optimation in the future"
begin back to the old character's design
amazing game. costs much lesser to whale is more fun and has amazing graphics. can run on low end devices as well
keep it up wuwa
"No other comments required, it's one of the best gacha games, if not the best in my opinion, with combat and visuals above others. Not to mention the devs, who are actively working on improvements. 10/10 I recommend it"
Best open world action game that I played and looking forward to see more coming character's with unique gameplay.
"actually peak cinema, cinematics, and characters are soooo good."
"When I played this, bru can't believe it was free cuz of the graphics, it was freaking cool! the gameplay is üò©üëå I play on mobile but it's running smoothly, it has a different graphics settings, so compatibility is not a problem! Kuro always cooking, like the story, the lore, everything is getting cooked deliciously üòóüëå I love everything abt this game! the best game I ever played so farüò© 100/10"
the designs of the character are magnificent by far this is better than any hoyo game by far srry hoyo
"I'm enjoying the updates from version 2.0 and onwards. I'm hoping for more exploration quests and puzzles, and also please add more 4 star Resonators. Thank you for the hard work."
This is the best gacha experience I have ever experienced been a day 1 player and it's still hitting although when you do everything like events and what not theres nothing to do so I wish they would add endgame where you can constantly repeat it Idk what reward they could give to make it engaging and feel worth it but I will and continue playing also still convincing my friends to play this over other gachas so yeah very good
"the game's story and gameplay is really good, especially now in 2.X patches, but the lack of male characters and overly sexualized female characters that continuously flirt with the main character is really annoying"
Optimise the game for us android users
best gacha game there is lol!!! the only thing i kinda find unsatisfactory is the fact that there are less male characters and storyline needs a little push and lessen fan service between rover and other adult female characters lol nonetheless this game is BOMB AF!!!!
niche game for waifu pullers
nice game
"Probably the best open world gacha game out there. Love the story up to Rinascita (havent played much from there sadly) a lot of great characters and combat feels pretty good + the exploration is a lot less tedious. The Hoyoshills trying to mass report the game are wrong btw the ""leaker"" isnt a leaker and the cameltoe cantarella part was a mod"
"(I had to do this in my sister's phone lol because my phone can't handle it and I watch with streamers) THIS GAME IS PHENOMENAL! The story telling is so good, the non-cutscenes felt like one and with the reason 2.2, the characters feel so alive and it makes me so invested in the story. Ciaccona is the prime example and she blew me away, I have never seen so much movement before ever since I got hooked into Genshin. The characters designs are spot on! I hope you continue cooking kuro!"
i love the game
"I love this game very much, spending hours and hours playing it. But look what is happening right now, I cannot even recognize it anymore. It became WORSE, don't you even care anymore? The harem, the annoying jiggle physics, the fan service, annoying! Also, why do you keep releasing female characters only? like where are the male characters?"
"Honestly is my very favorite game, but as the game updates. Its very disappointing I've been playing since release and its been my favorite game ever since. But ever since the rising controversy, is a real disappointment. Its so disappointing, why would the devs add such things? And as being labeled as a game for minors. Are the devs so money hungry that they have to add those particular details? So disappointing"
Good developers the gacha system is more friendly than the others. You can evsn skip yapping! thank u.
"I did enjoy this quite a bit till milestones became locked by tactical hologram. The dodge mechanic barely works on mobile and even the early stages of hologram are too finiky for a casual player. The game suffers from its own poor choices, there's a lot to like, but even more to dislike."
perfect üëå
one of the best gachas out there are its really f2p friendly
"i uninstalled it after 2.2 :( i played ever since 1.0 it was amazing at first, but i couldn't handle seeing every female character slowly glazing rover repetitively huhu it overshadows the story. maybe ill install it again if scar and geshulin (or any new male characters) become playable cause i, like many others downloaded the game because of them."
"love the game but the mini-games are always so eh for mobile. good on you if you're a PC player ig. if not, gl."
"This is honestly the best gacha game you can ask for. Everything is looking well polished because of these devs man!. F2P FRIENDLY and you can get those characters and save up really fast because of these generous rewards. The story and voice acting is getting better at 2.0+. The devs always listen to the community's feedback. Try it, you won't regret it and make sure to finally judge it if you are in the new region. I'll give it 5 stars and update my review every time it gets even better."
"simply amazing visuals, art, graphics, gameplay, story, game mechanics."
best game of all time
Im just here to say that pls make tacet field count as getting echo... thats all everything else is great thanks
I love the playstyle and character design so much and the quality is just chef kiss
"Overall satisfied with the game, everything is cool and all. But the censorship was kind of unnecessary."
Used to be good. Now it's apparent they're catering to the WRONG community. You were praised for listening to your players. What happened to it?
The overall game was the Best but My phone has a 8GB ram or 228 GB storage with snapdragon prosser but the game was still lagging even in low settings and the same side I play genshin impact in High graphics but I don't feel any lag accept my phone battery was less than 20% maybe it's because wuthering waves add to much mob because of them game are lagging or crashing. I request you to minimise the quantity of mobs they may help for those players who have an average device. give us good Play.
"I were not a huge fan of wuthering waves on release,in fact even thought of it as just another gacha game and nothing else I gave the game a try and still wasn't a huge fan besides the combat but after what they did with the black shore and Rinascita and the fact that the game have changed so much in such a short time. I can now say Wuthering Waves is the best gacha game I have played so far"
good experience
i really like the skip option which genshin doesn't give us played genshin for almost 3 years but now um hooked with this game mainly because of the gameplay similar to genshin and character design and battle option
why does my asia server account doesn't work i log in and it shows black screen fix it please that's my main account
The story was really awesome. And the graphics were just üîù in top levelüî•. Overall this game is a masterpiece and a best stress relaxing gameüòâüòåüëè
"way too exceptional and an amazing story it is worth giving time , just like genshin impact"
You guys slowing turning into hoyo...why
"Majestic, the latest update is really what made me want to stick around fro much longer they did a great job in improfing both the gameplay and quality"
good game
The Story Graphic are Absolute Cinema
"It's a very good game, very good graphics making my phone turn into the sun, the characters are well made and is very very very good characters,"
Very nice
"This takes open world anime based game to the next level, absolutely goated graphics, design, storyline, everything"
good game üëç
Why is there no Rinascita characters Emote/sticker
ngl the fan service is getting weird at this point
Hoyo could nvr
This game becoming gooner game
i love you but make more male characters please im begging
"This game is peak, if only it didn't drain my battery in 60 minutes I would've played this all day."
this game should be 16+ why you keep it back to 12+ for money??? you don't care about players feeling
great gameplay..stamina is most fav thing in wuwa
fkn storyline is amazing and the mechanics are hard but iykyk
"the best game ever,"
Love this game W kuro W devs W game.
Don't give up kuro even after false accusions and stupid plans from Genshin fans. You're doing nothing wrong and we all are rooting for you guys in future and be the best game every year
best gacha action adventure rpg i have ever played and it is so much better than genshin
Kuro... You can do it
"amazing game, good character design!!"

best game I swear
"I hope you're ok Kuro, keep strong, don't bother those H*yotard gensh*t mf, they just jealous because their game can't compete anymore. They know their st*pid game are losing and started reporting like crazy. I hope this issues can be solved early, we all support you Kuro ‚ù§Ô∏è"
this game is trash I got Verona in Cameliya banner in 100 pulls? fir what I just do another 900 pulls so I guess I got cameliya if 0.1 % chance this game not f2p anymore for banner üòí üòë now I eamil them and I know they just say you got verina in 100 pulls and the record was stuck on 33 why ? it's a feature
"Best game ever, The stories keeps on being better every update!"
"3rd review: One thing I would want is more male characters, the females are too many making the ratio off I would want the echo system to be better as well. The echo exp are too expensive and I really want the echo tuning to have some sort of pity system cause farming for my favourite character is such a pain, I would really want to use the useless echoes as well for exp and not for another echo, overall the game is great, still waiting for the character sigil"
Why always lagging while changli ultimate animation? while the others no? please fix this!! (play on iqoo 13 16gb ram & internal 512gb)
"The dev is really putting up an effort to improve the game. The laggy gameplay really improved so much after the updates and it became smoother unlike when the first day it was officially launched in google play. Also, kuro is spoiling us to be honest, I'm so shocked by the number of astrites given to me. I'll be expecting that this game will be better after fixing the few bugs and glitches(*¬¥ÔπÄ`*) ILYSM KURO, thanks for listening to us players!!"
I don't need to say anything more
"I feel kinda Sad for censorships, People just dont understand that this game is a fantasy and these designs are normal... Kuro games keep it more interesting so that I wouldnt have to download other gacha games, dont let those people who bad mouth the company ruin the game...Thanks for the freebies"
WHERE THE MALE CHARACTERS ATüíî
great game
little bit lagge but a good game
Please add function can enable or disable sensorship content please we're really love this game
Top best game for me
"Solid game overall, immense potential but not for long. The story later on is good, but the exposition is so bad I wouldn't recommend it to anyone. Optimization used to be huge but with recent 2.X its getting worse. Character m to f ratio is siginificantly worse now and catered towards male audience. The quality of life and dev generosity is much worse then what it used to be, the game grinding, events, ui, exploration, vfx and animation also starts to get caught by competitors. Not recommended"
One of the best games I have ever played.
"the good point in this game is not half baked and not tagged with ""family friendly"" like the other one with family friendly tag but still exposing body. Kuro will be the developer of GOAT"
"I found my favorite game. I like this game because MC like a real MC, not a NPC MC."
peak
pls make the male-female ratio evenly otherwise your game is basically gathering wives
yep I love this game now
Devs listen every time. Satisfied with the current story pace and the quality. Need more optimization for mobile devices. PC optimization is fine. The best in genre.
Great game! Hope it continues to get better and put other greedy gaming companies in the dust.
"Very Linear story so far, every character you meet just fawns over you for no reason. The open world feels vast and there is a lot to explore, but none of it seems to matter or relate back to the main character or the supporting characters, which makes the world...feel empty. Each characters design and combat mechanics feel good, but the action combat is buggy at times. Sometimes you counter when you shouldn't and vice versa, the enemy boss animation or yours clips thru and you do nothing."
you're a good gaming company. Please don't ruin your game by adding too much fanservice. I can barely play the game because canterella is so distracting. I really love this game it'd be sad if it turned out like genshin.
perfect
Just keep up the good work wuwa
"Please Optimize this game for all mobile this is incredible every updated version more experience and more storyline, Optimize this it's very helpful for gamer's thanks"
Solid game!
"Absolute best experience I've had across this genre. I've played a LOT of gachas, but this one takes the cake. Combat actually feels good and has some intricacy to it, exploration is fun rather than clunky with unique puzzles and boy oh boy, Kuro goes the extra mile to take care of their players. Every gacha will have some predatory monetization of course, but as far as that goes, I've never seen one thats been this generous to F2P players. Oh and the visuals and cinematics?... CINEMA"
"best QOL ever , not slow paced game , the flying is really good , hope we can use it in every part of the map. overall great game"
I really like the game the explanation is really fun and I actually enjoy it I like the fights they're really unique I don't mind the story quests they're just a bit hard to understand. the only complaint I have is that there is a lack of male characters and it's the only thing really ruining the game for me. I'd really like a few more male characters over anything else.
"gud game gud life, keep it up ü´†"
I tried it out pf curiosity and I'm glad that wuthering waves is my first open world game i played I joined in 1.4 and all I can say it only got better and better I hope kuro games would not change despite the many things
Very good gacha
best game ever
"I love this game so much, however I am very disappointed in the lack of lore and the male to female ratio. If this game were to release more male characters and not make everybody simp for the rover, I would literally call this game perfect. Still 5 stars, but please listen. I do appreciate how good this game looks and how polished it is. Cinematics are on point and exploration is very fun while also not too time-consuming. NEED MORE MALES THOUGH..."
If you're not playing this game if missing something. The gameplay is console level and story is Straight up Anime. So let's give it a shot ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞ü•∞
good game
An absolutely amazing game full of interesting things to do and the characters are so unique but also all extremely intriguing when you go through their stories. These devs clearly care about their game and their community and actually fix things when they are brought up. I am so happy to be playing this game knowing they truly care.
"Fast-paced and satisfying combat, beautiful visuals and animations, nice story since 2.0, beautiful characters with deep backgrounds, overall an excellent game"
"just beautiful, nothing less. Sorry to say but definitely worth dropping genshin for"
"I found this game life changing, so I would say that you wouldn't regret playing it if you have fairly good taste. the game will feel slow at first, but it gets better as it goes"
pretty good game
"I am happily playing this game, has been my stress reliever for a long time now after a certain greedy gacha game burnt me out. The rewards are abundant! I love wuwa honestly each update just makes me so happy, very much!"
One of the best open world game to play. The characters are awesome and good looking designwise. The skills are unique. The environment is beautiful. The dev are always listening. Hope they keep it up.... :)
the best game I've ever played. like a breath of fresh air after genshin impact(which is supposedly for —Ä–µd–æphiles lol‚ò†Ô∏è‚ò†Ô∏è)
I hope that you would imrpove the future character after what happened to Cantarella so the game won't get reported
"the game is wonderful based on gameplay, animations and designs. BUT THERE'S SO MUCH GOONER BAITS!!! ADD MORE MALES SHEESH!!!!"
For my first open world game This is soooo gooddddd I'm hooked on it everyday So peakkkkk
Simply the best
"The 2.2 update for Wuthering Waves delivers a wealth of new content, significant gameplay enhancements, and exciting new characters. It underscores the developers' dedication to creating a compelling and evolving gaming experience, making it even more enjoyable for all players."
"It's an amazing game with great character designs and also amazing characters in general. The story is something I find enjoyable, and it's constantly improving from the first version. Although it is a bit fanservice-y, I don't mind, as that detail has never been a problem for me whatsoever, and most of the time I enjoy it. The mechanics are satisfying, and the game itself causes me to enjoy fighting, with it being rewarding in my own mind. I hope this game stays for a long time."
"been playing since launch and it's my fav gacha I've played in years, the dev never let us down <3 kuro"
beautiful game for phone
love it
the game is good and fun to explore the world
"The best game among competitors is not limited by new banners, as seen in other games. It truly offers an amazing world and story building experience. I hope its performance continues to be consistent in the future as well."
"First game of its genre in my midrange budget phone, nice character design and generous rewards... although the FPS on mobile could be more optimized since I struggle to have 60 FPS consistently even with the rest of the settings on low (I use Poco X7 Pro)"
Please add Ai translator cause some of us don't speak any of the languages you provided
wuthering flop ananta gonna kill your game
"the overall, and late game experience is absolutely phenomenal in the genre. there's only one problem, i wish devs would rework the story in the beginning, it's really hurting the new player experience, I've been playing the game since day one (so that part of the story doesn't bother me anymore) but if it was better I'd be able to recommend the game to more and more people."
"For those unaware, Wuthering Waves is not Kuro Games first mobile game. They launched Punishing Gray Raven globily a few years early, and like WuWa had a very rough start. But they continued supporting the game and, since then, has been one of the best mobile action games I have ever played. Wuthering Waves had its rough start, but I believe in Kuro games because of the accomplishments with their previous game. The character designs, the world, story and combat will only get better from here."
"Addictive & Immersive! Wuthering Waves is an incredible game that's got me hooked! The unique blend of exploration, strategy, and relaxation is absolute perfection. Stunning visuals, captivating soundtrack, and intuitive controls make for an unforgettable experience. I love discovering hidden secrets and upgrading my gear. A true masterpiece!"
"Great open world mobility and skills makes exploration a lot of fun, like running on walls, grappling and ledge grab. The characters are very expressive and the designs are great. Love the graphics, not to mention the music in this game is phenomenal. Echo's, aka artifacts in other games, can be farmed in open world instead of just domains which makes coop really fun to play with. You can farm boss artifacts with friends without expanding any resources, made upgrading characters really fun."
I love it very beautiful
a game that respects player time.
fan service is getting a little bit too much. there is already tons of gacha games that have intense fan services and sexualize women characters ALOT. wuthering waves has such good potential for making REAL good playable character + story line yet currently kuro is only focused on feeding the incels again and again. I love cantarella but honestly it's just getting too much it's like the game is only made for men and no one else. (I give 4* because I think the company is already under pressure.)
"I hate this game so much. don't you think the fan service is getting out of hand? do better, nobody signed up for a gooner game. you would've gained more money and attention if you ditched fan service and kept making more male characters."
"Absolutely love the gameplay and the story. It's the horrible banner mechanics, chances are horrible that's fine most gachas are. But for the pity mechanic to not even 100% give you the unit from the banner is scummy. It just says you don't care about your players you care about their money. Better pity mechanics would keep me playing and keep money coming in, instead I feel burned so they got a one time purchase from me and that's it, uninstalling and probably not coming back."
i support this not the other game
"The character designs are top notch and the story animations, not the cutscene but the little details like drinking from a cup make this game even better."
"PGR player here , and kuro always make a good story , generous with reward and make a lot of cool gameplay"
"next time just put the tag #harem in your game, not even worth anything as someone who expects something better and waits for YEARS for this game. There's no inclusivity in gender in this game that it's better just to call it female oriented game."
constant crashes upon starting to play the game. pretty sure the game is not optimized to be handled by phones.
dear kuro. you mf hologram dragon boss is weak against me. please make a stronger boss like soul game. example malenia and promise consort radan before nerf owl father lume knight nameless king. and don't nerf any boss.
"Amazing experience, feels illegal to play this beautiful game for free, the scenery is mesmerizing."
"Wuthering Waves captures the heart in a way that resonates deeply with its community, weaving a tapestry of understanding and inclusivity. Unlike some other games, such as Genshin Impact, which often seem to focus primarily on Chinese players, Wuthering Waves listens intently to each whispered wish and heartfelt sentiment from players around the world. This sincere engagement creates a world that is undeniably enchanting."
Good game keep going Kuro games
Absolutely Wonderful!!! And thank you devs and everyone at kurogames for giving everyone such a fantastic and beautifully well crafted game and art. I would always support you kuro and your games!
keep up the good work kuro
"KURO HEAR ME OUT üôèüèª PLEASE JUST IGNORE EVIL VOICES AND DO WHATEVER YOU GUYS WANT THE BEST FOR THIS GAME , WE LOVE YOUU GUYS SO SO MUCH , ONE THING THAT I HOPE IS WUTHERING WAVES CAN BECOME AS COOL AS PGR , I HOPE YOU GUYS CAN DO BETTER AND BETTER FOR EVERY UPDATE SENDING HUGS FOR ALL ! ‚ù§Ô∏è"
keep going with the great updates with that game it is always improving and the devs keep listening .. had to give it a full review because they actually care about the game not your money thank you and keep your progress up
Never ceased to amaze. keep cooking!
I wish I could post multiple reviews. This game is an absolute blast. Never has a game company listened and catered to their F2P players as much as Kuro. The gameplay and design is top notch. 10/10 Recommended.
I love the story and gameplay mechanics
good
"my first impression of the game was i thought it was the same as genshi or genshi copy, but after diving down into the game, I realized that this game is far beyond what I have thought. The world exploration, combats, storytelling, character designs, and quality of life everything is perfect. This game is undeniable one of the best games i ever play. Kuro game deserves our respect."
"After taking a break for a while then coming back for patch 2.0, I can say that Kuro REALLY outdone themselves. Ragunna City brought so much life back into the game and it's great to see this game thriving now. I've been a Day 1 PGR player so I know that Kuro is capable of so many things and I can't wait to see what else the Devs got for us. I will say, the PS5 version of the game needs some work. There's constant stuttering and screen tearing on it. I hope that can get fixed soon"
"i like this game, but pls fix the update, let the player download only for the update not the whole game"
best game
stop the disgusting fanservice
GREAT GAME
"I love how the game is very f2p, and how the devs are very fast to fix things!"
the best
"Good job, Kuro!"
2.2 story was so absolute peak cinema that genshin could never.
Another gooner game notthing new
Loved that game until they decided that releasing oversexualized childish-looking female characters is more important than listening to their players and releasing some really wanted characters from the Mainstory... very disappointed
downloaded this for Cantarella
it's a bad experience
"Stop sexualixing your female characters, it's disgusting. Oh, I have another complain, stop making a harem. It's uncomfortable to watch. Making your female characters act all lovey-dovey and obsessed for rover ü§ì it's just so ü§¢"
"This game is super fun to play, with amazing battle mechanics, a fluid system, and a well-balanced roster of characters. The story is amazing and engaging with great music settings, animations, and well written. This company is well generous and constantly checking playerbase feedback for improvements."
"I love this game so much. It has good graphics, amazing gameplay, fun combats, etc. Got addicted for 2 months after startingüî•üî•"
"game baik, dari pada gensh1n kikir"
peak üò≠üôè
cantarella's physics was so damn weird
amazing game
it's peak
"Devs listen. There's always gonna be contraversy surrounding a gatcha game but I'd say kuro handles their issues very well. Since 1.0 the story has improved significantly, gameplay has been optimized, music has improved much more, and the character designs have been pretty appealing. I hope kuro keeps up the good work."
"the gameplay mechanics are really good especially the dodge mechanics and parry mechanics are insane, the character lore is good, one of the stories almost makes me cry especially the story between shorekeeper, rover and the black shores, If you played this game you never get tired of playing some of the characters. Keep doing your best kuro. I love this game so much üòç"
"It's a very fun game, the overworld exploration, combat, and character desings. The only thing i want is for it to improve it's gaming performance for low end devices, to at least play smoothly on the Lowest graphics. Overall the game is awesome."
Lessen the jiggle physics and bring men like how you bring women in the game
Beautiful game especially the scenery
"Best gacha game ever made,"
"I need more male characters, and less fan service it makes ur game even more disgusting. And I hope you and your game won't to be nominated in each game awards because how stupid you doing things now, I would be gladly appreciated if really redesign hell out of cantarella"
"best gacha game ever. character design, lore, map, quests, character kits, rewards and VA's. the rewards are so much better than genshin. I quit genshin because of it, and now I've moved to this. it is really great. I love it. keep going!!!"
Great
"It was good in the first release but it eventually starts to get boring specially almost every character have feelings to the mc, I played for the combat not for these disgusting sexualized characters also the story is boring asff, It was so good before whyd it turn to a harem game,as a man myself how the woman dress and move in this game are concerning, please do better and treat every character equal because men in this game as well girl mc doesn't get the same treatment as the women and mmc."
"Excuse me,kuro games,can you guys low down the ram for this game because whenever I play it,it gets laggy,so can you guys low down the ram so I can play better?"
"very good, im waiting for zani !!!"
good game with listening developers UNLIKE some other gacha game but lacks male characters.
it's lagging on my low deviceüò≠
"Ah I start playing this game on my tablet which is too average (4gb ram, unisoc t616 processor) ,but still game run at 40-50 fps. Nice game but I need more optimization so I can enjoy really!, btw nice very very."
The best Gacha game I could have played. The story is very beautifully written and the renders shows how much efforts the developer made to make it so good.
"I have no expectations for kuro games' male character roster anymore, I should've known that since I played PGR. (the latest update where there was male character content in PGR was almost A YEAR AGO, and it was just 1 skin/coating) I kept on holding onto my expectations since we all know kuro always listens to player feedback, but till now there isn't any changes. Brant is probably going to be the only male character in patch 2.X iam disappointed but it's my fault for expecting big anyways."
"Don't play unless you're a male gooner who just wants female characters with heavy fanservice - as a day 1 player I can say that the game started with so much charm and potential, but had just become like any other typical harem-like gatcha game."
absolute cinema üñêÔ∏èüòêüñêÔ∏è
mantapp
"really great, but carefull, its gamble to get characters"
One of the best gacha games I have ever played
"it's a good game, really. the mechanic, the story, the quests, the graphic.. are all mesmerising and fun. But, the limited characters are mostly females and that doesn't really appeal to me. not to mention the lack of new 4 star characters. fav characters are really important for me to keep playing the game. I hope the game will add more characters that I like. I would gladly spend money when they come."
"well though it lags alot on my s23 fe, I like this game. But if devs can optimize this game in away that it can run smoothly in mobiles with good graphics that would be awesome üëå"
One of the better games I have played in mobile. This game is so generous and f2p friendly with very good QOL changes every update. Thousands times better than Genshin Impact.
Gonna be completely honest and unbiased when I say it's been the best experience of any game I've played.....excluding the bugs and lags it had at launch..... I love this game. Ty Kuro‚ô°
this game good
Best game ever!!!!
where are the freakin men kuro
"its horrible, disgusting, the story is very very mary sue, with all that every character loves mc, mc is very strong, they're handsome/beatiful and all that. so cheap and boring. Huanglong was good. blackshores was mid and rinascita might be your downfall."
"Wuthering Waves is easily one of the best mobile games out there. The world-building is top-notch, the boss fights are intense and skill-based, and the storyline actually pulls you in. Dodge and parry mechanics feel super smooth and rewarding. It was a bit choppy on my iPhone 11 at launch, but now it runs perfectly. You can tell the devs truly care -they listen, improve, and constantly deliver. This game is a gem. Don't miss it."
"It's one of my favourite games of all time. The combat is just so astonishing and unique, and the amount of content already in the game is mind-blowing. 10/10 The developers are very generous and kind towards their players. This game is a MUST try."
"I'm having trouble linking my Google account to my email in the account center because I got logged out and I tried to login using Google but it seems like Google and email are two different logins. I deleted my new account ingame (the one with my Google account) and removed my connection to the new account in my Google account so that I can connect my Google account to my email account but it's still saying ""The account is already linked to another account"""
Edit: wuwa is the definition of WASTED potential
one of the best ever I played
"Okay, the fanservice is visible but damn why do people whine so much about it? Every game has fanservice either you like it or not. Wuthering waves has cantarella and she is a very well-written character, also, Zani, whom is coming to wuwa later. takes off her tie and breaks the front part of the shirt, I mean, she is fighting and work clothes isn't going to he comfortable, anyway, fanservice. I am a girl and I find it acceptable. I need men though. 4 or 5 stars idc.MEN!"
"My 2nd review and all I can say is, ""This is the best gacha game I have played so far"", Since the beginning I've been playing it and since then every update is an improvement to all players, even I only play this game in my phone but still the experience is still magnificent, I always answered the survey honestly so I guessed this game always listen to the players, I would be happy to invest my money to this game because every aspect of it is nearly perfect and worth itü•∞ü•∞"
"The game is amazing including everything like the animation, graphics, smooth gameplay and overall the story too!"
noice
"Best Open-World Game I've played, maybe just change the rating to 18+ since a lot of haters trying to sabotage this beautiful game"
Amazing game! Storyline and Animation is just absolutely fireüòÄ
okay it's constantly crashing on me now and I need to know why
NEEDS MORE MALE CHARACTERS!!!
"We promise. We delivered. Beautiful game, and my only complaint is I can't give seven star for this review."
best game ever
"Not gonna lie, I was not expecting it to be this good"
"It's amazing, the story, scenery and even side characters are unique. I do wish there was more male characters(it feels very fan servicey for male audiences) but even so all the characters are so easy to adore. truly a unique game with even more so unique and challenging gameplay!"
Worst artifact system in gacha
"This game was fun for a while until the fan service got WAYY too extreme. Sure, the game has fun gameplay and all but now Scar and Geshu Lin aren't playable CMONNN BORRINGG"
I enjoy the game but it just take too much space
PEAK
"To begin with‚ÄîI would love to praise all the devs that have been handling this game. Thank you for listening to all your players and constantly asking for our opinion, may you all live long and healthy. As for the game (combat) mechanics, it's actually fun, the way you parry, dodges, etc. Exploration is also at its finest especially the story quest. Started at 1.0 and I can see the progress y'all made, such a big difference. Thank you for your service, I will forever want WUTHERING WAVES. üôá"
"i was planning on buying lunite sub and monthly pass to get zani cuz i spent a lot on the new char cantarella but changed my mind after censorship, revert character designs or make it age optional like other games does they censor only if player is not age appropriate, dont compromise on your character designs kuro."
"look I really like the game, it's one of the best gacha games I've ever played but please ease it down a bit with the fan service‚òπÔ∏è"
"Amazing game, sometimes I wonder how is this game free. everything about it is just 10/10"
Story and voice acting gets better after a few hours. combat is fantastic. The developers will make your FBI agent jealous with how well they listen.
Love this game and story but is it really hard to translation #WUWAPTBR
Yay
Cantarella carried
"Used to play and love the game, but I gave up on this because of the way the female characters were sexualized too much. Could be a masterpiece, they ruined it."
Soooo Goooodd!!!!!
Disappointed with your censorship now. and I've seen drastic changes to graphics. it looks kinda like a mind craft. the floors are just flat pictures now.
"Wuthering Waves really listened to their players and kept improving their game. Literally best Gacha game out there. Absolutely stunning visuals and Music Don't listen to the negative reviews , it seems Hoyoshills are mad that this game is better and trying to review bomb it."
my only complaint is a large issue for me. it seems kuro would rather put more effort into jiggle physics than creating more playable male characters. uninstalling until they release another male unit
"I love LOVE this absolute masterpiece, character designs, the environment details the music? oh I ABSOLUTELY LOVE the music in this game. the song ""dancing through fantasies""is currently one of my favs! everything is amazing! oh please give it a try! the rewards are so generous don't even get me started! I listen to the music whenever I am going to sleep, it's just that amazing. I am in love with the stories and the character stories are absolute masterpieces as well!"
Game story is good But like graphics in mobile are hell and I have a gaming phone still so blur graphics I even tried to play on max settings but like blur graphics please fix this issue
I comeback in this game and it's become more great than before
"Really fun game, even better than Genshin Impact at the moment! Huonglong's story was a bit dry and tedious to get through, and the voice acting was a bit mid, but once Rinascita released it was an amazing breath of fresh air! It is imperative that you keep up the momentum and not let the game's quality slide like how Genshin Impact's and Star Rail's did."
"I love and adore this game, but the mobile version has been crashing constantly in the last month! It's unplayable!"
"This game is becoming like every other gacha, lame. Why not have more male characters when most players joined because they wanted Scar as a playable character."
"ABSOLUTE CINEMA. The best Gacha game you can play by a mile, good devs, good updates, amazing combat, very generous events and freebies, keep it up! Keep the work going, we believ in your success, I LOVE YOU"
"Kuro made a interesting, albeit a tad slow paced open world game that was very enjoyable in the beginning. But now the game feels more like a harem, soft-core hentai advertisement game. there was no reason to include a camel toe on Cantrellas character model. There's fanservice then there's softcore porn, the lack of male characters is a joke now too BTW. Scar is most likely unplayable and they'll probably just release a unbuffed Calcharo alone for 3.0. Pretty game. nice rewards, incel devs."
"Changing content after release on limited characters and enemies without notice or a good reason is not ok. Censorship is bad. This game was better because it had more mature content and that's why I gave it more chances but now this is uncertain. No one should be scammed to pay for censorship. I am sorry if the game is going on such a dark path, who knows if even old characters are safe from malicious changes. All this after the last region was such an amazing improvement world wise."
"Best gacha game i played so far and also love the story , and i love their game company kuro games , they are very nice and generous devs , at the moment of writing i have seen a couple of evidence that wuthering waves is being attacked by hoyoverse game fanss , so please do good research on this before hurting wuthering waves game reputation please , because ZZZ - zenless zone zero game have way worse fanserve over 18+ age stuff than wuwa and its still on 12+ age rating while wuwa is 16+ unfair"
better then genshin in any caseüíñ
PEAK
absolutely love this game. kuro games always cooks üî•
Makays Character please
"Hello dear Kuro Games I respectfully request you: Remove the censorship applied to existing characters! Please do this, your good game with censorship is not attractive"
changing characters' designs even slightly from what they were advertised as after people paid for them isn't a good look.
"Hello dear Kuro Games I respectfully request you: Remove the censorship applied to existing characters! Please do this, your good game with censorship is not attractive at all..! If the game situation is critical, we are even deeply satisfied with the button to ‚Ä≥change censorship to uncensored.‚Ä≥ :) Thank you very much to your team for listening to us!"
theres legit no male characters ??? theres like 3 playable
Worth it installing
"game nya keren, dan oh iya kuro games... tolong kasi aku senjata cantarellaüò≠üò≠"
brant rerun NOW üíî
"The game used to be an action-focused open-world experience, but now it‚Äôs slowly turning into a waifu-collecting game. I still remember at launch, they hinted at having more male characters, especially with the introduction of Jiyan, clearly aimed at attracting the female fanbase but over time, they let that side of the fanbase down. With the overwhelming number of female characters now, the community has started to feel more like an incel hub, which is honestly disappointing."
peak cinema
The censorship situation is embarrassing just for a f*ing line or shadow or whatever it is even if it was modeled you want to tear the devs that made the game so much better after 1.1 and 2.0 and kept giving out generous rewards and good QOLs because you can't get off after that line is gone? You're so shallow. Any new players that were coming to Wuwa they all did a 180 turn and never looked back please don't listen to these rats they don't know what color grass.
"dropping the score for now since it looks like you're starting to censor things. I was so impressed with Fleurdelys just for you to put weird shorts on her. (don't ""refine"" her model. put it back the way it was. it was already perfect.)"
Not gonna lie but really this game improves alot from the last time when I played.
nice
amazing gameplay and graphics ! truely stunning details and easter eggs i can't get enough of how is this game free ! just don't listen to others and do your part W for the devs this is how gacha suppose to be friendly for all the players ! if you are truely greatful spread love support them and let them cook !
I love wuthering waves it's so much fun. ü´†üëç
this will be the only gacha game I will always play :}
"my device is low, but this game is good"
I miss the old Wuwa. Great storyline and all but now...Very disappointing Kuro all those great characters are wasted because the game is slowly turning into a fan service. Been here since the game released and been supporting the game but now...I think I'll stick to PGR. (Pathetic Gooner Design Kuro. Bravo.) changed my Ratings to 1.
"Waiting for Bianca,Would be better if the game gonna make 2 version of character design instead of cens and non cens would be cool.People could select which one to use.Also Rover need a costume.Not much game does that imo,Other than that,The game is Amazing (Even do i barely have time playing it).You guys did a great job!"
great games but will be better if we can have 1 more spot on our team.too little spots for so many good characters that we want to play.
"This game is by far the best open game i have ever played, the playstyle is absolutely satisfying. Although i have a few problems. 1. The character balance of this game. Out of 31 characters, only 7 are MALE characters. 2. The random romance from female characters. Every single female characters that had been released recently had been obsessed with MC, it was cute with shorekeeper but now it's just pure harem."
this is slowly becoming a gooner game
best android game
"good. good. yes. the quality, graphics and stuffs are amazing. but fudge it, this game is becoming a gooner game for male incels. they could have SO MANY chances to be good but chose not to. atp, im sure most NORMAL HEALTHY male players out there are as tired of ts as the female players. please considering listening to players instead of ruining great potential for games like this."
it's better now but not great
"I'm so glad I quit HSR. I love the new free mechanics in this game. I haven't had much luck pulling the new 5 star characters, but I still enjoy. I have way less burnout and I get a good amount of rewards so I can pull characters. Thanks Kuro Games! : )"
thx for all the five star
absolute cinema
the greatest relaxing game of all time
"so many elements of a game is in this game, my phone battery kept dying since I discovered this game. I do wish there were more male character leads though than female. I've started 2 weeks ago and most main stories were about women, hoping to see more main male stories."
"The story is wonderful, but I don't know how far we've come for the game to start getting boring and turning into a harem. As someone who's known Wuthering Waves since the game's beta and has been playing since its launch, it's pretty disappointing. It's that old saying: when life gives you lemons, make lemonade... but Kuro basically threw those lemons away, in my honest opinion."
The game is great and have a good story and the battle mechanic is super cool and amazing but the only problem I have is that the game is not optimize on mobile and so frustrating even if I set it on low graphics please optimize the game more so it will be playable
So they're going towards adding more females into the game that's gonna be their main focus?? I literally started playing this game mostly for the male characters they do not care about the female side of the fandom not one bitty bit üíÄüôè
Devs listen!
"Absolute Cinema, but I kinda wish Kuro put more advanced rendering graphics option for mobile cuz pc Vs phone graphics difference is earth and heaven. it feels very jarring to watch npcs and assets pop out every few feet of walking."
"Endgame event like whimpering waste and other are really hard to do for casuals like me, even getting reward is really fix it"
"Don't get me wrong, the game's good. But I just don't feel confident anymore collecting new characters. The character's design could get changed after u pull them. Recently Cantarella's design changed after she got released."
the game itself is good but unfortunately even on the lowest of settings the game crashes on my phone and my phone great at holding gacha games such like wuwa but not wuwa
the game is perfect but lately I found out that 1 of my characters vanished like it is not in my acc anymore. I can play with that character and it says that I don't have that character
"this will become a FIVE star IF you add MORE MALE CHARACTERS, PLEASE PLEASE PLEASE DON'T BE ANOTHER GOONER GAME. YOU'RE ACTUALLY VERY GOATED KURO IF YOU LISTEN TO MOST OF THE REQUEST OF THE PLAYERS AND PRETTY PLEASE WITH THE CHERRY ON TOP ADD MORE MALE CHARACTERS, I DONT MIND THE WOMEN LIKE NICE TIDDIES (Am I Right?) BUT I NEED TO GOON ON MENNNNNNNNNN. I WANT MENNNNNNN. PLEASE KURO I WILL GIVE YOU MY LIFE IF YOU ADD MORE MALE CHARACTERSü•∫ü´µüôè"
so good
"Amazing, but sometimes story is bland"
i just came back and it asked for feedback
Phone Optimization please! (I'm playing on Realme c21-y)
"The game lags a lot on my phone, even though I‚Äôve played Genshin Impact on the same device with zero lag or stutter. That clearly shows it‚Äôs not a hardware issue but an optimization problem. The visuals and concept are amazing, but the lag ruins the experience completely. I don‚Äôt mind if the game takes 10‚Äì20 GB more space‚Äîjust optimize it properly so it can run smoothly. Please prioritize performance over compactness. You have the potential to make this game great, but right now it feels laggi"
Very good fast paced skill based open world game with f2p rewards.
it started good . but just 2 days ago i was planning to buy jinshi's outfit which is expensive by the way. the very same day i got to know that they altered the design of another character who is already released and people had that character including me. and even for minor adjustments it is a scam to the players. kuro games lost my trust. dont become genshin impact which i left for becoming a childish game .
best.
kuro isnt greedy like hoyoverse and devs listen
Excuse me kuro games sorry but I'm getting frequent crashes.. And i am asking you to fix this please... Except Crashes and lags everything is just fire üî• it's addictive story and immense fights are just super mobile version 11 storage 46.57 gb
"Great gameplay, nice voice acting, game design and story writing. Top tier genshin alternative; probably even better. 10/10 Would recommend."
os cool
wuthering wives
This is a complete masterpiece. Chef's kiss for the cinematic and action scenes!
This game is very good but the reward is like my wage Minimum
The female ratio is getting out of hand why are there more females where are the Males????. Atp ZZZ might be better when it comes to male ratio
keep it up kuro games don't give a damn about what others say this game is the best gacha game out there and these tards who are getting mad at for a little censorship are just braindead ppl who don't know how games actually work u are doing great and thank you for everything
"I loved the story, combat and overall the open worldn however the game is poorly optimized for my device, the graphcis look blurry and it hangs like hell..hope it gets optimized soon"
BEST GAME EVER
"This Wuthering Waves is really great game and the characters are also good. It's really cool and perfect, The story quests is not bad very fun. I hope this game will update more realistic and beautiful open world games."
"best game, I love gacha games like genshin but wuthering waves is just so amazing"
"I love the game. It's versatile and engaging, the developers actually listen to the fans. Personally I consider it f2p friendly as a f2p player myself."
it's amazing how people think kuro is changing the age rating when they have no control over it and only get notified of said age rating change. keep up the good work kuro!
"peak game, very bad optimization for mid end Android devices and very laggy in ultra performance mode. Hope they optimize this game for mid end devices properly."
"Great exploration, i can play it for hours without getting bored even when low on energy/stamina"
Best game
best graphics
What a game üî•üî•üî•
one of best games i have played
"Well I don't generally waste my time posting views but hoyogays have forced me to put one now. WELL IF YOU HATE GENSHIN IMPACT and want something relaxing, awarding with top tier animation and characters. This is your game way relaxing and reliable , The devs will listen to you and the player base and make adjustments in the next update. It's character animation are even above what hoyogames can offer, they are not just box models like that of mihoyo."
SUPERB GAME! 10/10 PEAK AFTER PEAK EVERY PATCH!!! BEEN PLAYING SINCE DAY 1
"Only rated it 2 because of frequent soft lock on loading screen, I have no choice to reopen the game every 10 minutes. Plz fix the issue. It's been TWO years."
Too many gacha.
best gacha game known to man
this game actually has a good story and it's fun. you have a chance to get good pulls unlike most gacha games.
"don't get me wrong, i love this game so much, everything but the way it sexualizes woman. please, it's just that i don't want this game to ruin itself only because of that flaw. i would highly suggest to bring many more male characters, and stop sexualizes female character by their appearance or behavior. again, i say this because i love the game and don't want many people hating this game because of that"
"this is practically console quality .Great graphics, solid story line, amazing all around game"
"The game has pretty good graphics, characters, all good, just the character's movement motion needs to be improved a little more.The biggest thing is that I can skip conversations üòÅüëçüèª"
thanks for the game
I changed my mind again I don't like it it's sooooooo gonnnnnner game ew I quit gathering wives no males I hope your downfall will be soon enough
"I already downloaded almost 20 gb, yet when I return it says download another 17gb. Mobile version is broken"
best gacha game out there
Oml best game ever trust me
"I had so much fun playing this game, Now I feel like it should help support lower devices. But apart from that the game was amazing, Now I started playing this game in the start a V5.5 on genshin, I had to much fun I didn't even notice it's been 17 days lol. But I feel it's easier to get 5s and all that, LOVE THIS GAME PLAY IT"
"The story, the fight, the character.... or it's entirety the whole game is awesome‚ù§Ô∏è‚Äçüî•"
My new favorite game<3
"Currently, as of early 2025, the best open world gacha you can play. Great exploration and traversal Exceptional world design and story Attractive characters and competitive gacha rates"
Keep up the good work
kindly improve this game's insanely unstable server connections and frames per second on low end devices i'm waiting ages for this please kurogames make wuwa playable in mobiles and all servere
game good
"Wuthering Waves is a great potential and every updates are even improving, especially the 2.X versions. I really love these challenging gameplay mechanics, intriguing story with unexpected twists, many unforgettable characters, and everything with a satisfying experience, given the developers' generosity and capacity of responding player feedback. Aside from lags & internet issues, I'm still going forward."
"Great game, great dev"
great game ever
"-The aesthetic in this game is really nice it has a more of a darker color scheme, and I love it -Every character has been so unique and it great. It makes playing more diverse and fun -The developers listen to the users really well -its very F2P friendly! -Great exploration, but 1.x areas is harder and a bit more clunky than 2.x areas -Story is pretty good. I haven't finished every personal quest, but Encore's story made me tear up; very well executed!"
"The best gacha game i have ever played. I'm in love with the character designs and combat and the post-apocalyptic setting. 2.0 is insane! Edit: 2.2 was an AMAZING patch in every way possible. Story, Avinoleum map and the side stories from within, character introduction for Carthetiya and Cantarella, fixing Whimpering Wastes and pretty chill and rewarding events. One thing that i'd like is that you add 120 fps support for Ryzen 5 series too( i play 99% on PC)"
combat is peak company cares for fans peak character designs peak character stories 10/10 peak game
good
it's ausome
"The cause of censorship is XianJiaJun(Mihoyo Most Fanatic Fans) due to mass reporting. Just want to point out is the censorship will not come to Nikke, Browndust 2 and Genshin even with those games having more revealing and harder sexual innuendo. Hope you devs can recover"
Optimize the graphics like genshin for mid range phones. Genshin is way smoother to play.
"This is a Gacha Game, true. But it's probably the best Gacha game I've played. The story, especially in 2.0, is comparable to AAA titles, the animations are amazing, combat is fluid and over all, it is very fun to play. I love the character designs, Changli is my favorite so far, Canterella is their newest character and she's way more than just fan-service. The developers are amazing as well, they listen to their player base and add/adjust things based on feedback. It is 100% worth checking out"
"best gacha, most engaging story after 2.0, wonderful environment and combat"
thank you kuroo!!! this is the best game! I hope you also added men in the next patchü©µü©µ
"Mostly play on the PC version, but just wanted to leave a positive review here as well. This game is an absolute gem with 100s of hours of entertainment. Definitely a must play. Ps, the devs for this game are absolute legends."
honestly I was a strictly genshin player and I heard of wuthering waves and didn't find it appealing till i actually buckled down and played it and it's safe to say that it was everything i wanted in a game. although I must say the women characters in the game have shown interest in the main character but to be honest I don't really mind ü§≠
I have problem in my account and I don't know how to connect with the game team to fix it
i love you
the 2.2 story was very amazing
"All I know nevertheless the games are absolute cinema when it comes to cutsceen and the gameplay is phenomenal too, I plays this game since launch and still playing because of its intriguing story telling and it's graphics are masterpiece too, all I know I love this game so much that is all for my performance review"
You know why this is positive.
One of the best gacha games on the market that is only getting better and better with every patch
"when i first played on release there's many performance issues, e.g. the open world felt generic-ish, but they keep improving and fixing those issues on every iteration of game patches. Now since 2.0 it's clear how much they've improved, performance issues are pretty much gone; the open world is stunning and unique, the 2.0/Rinascita area is easy and fun to traverse with flying and traversal echo mechanism and it doesn't feel empty nor cramped."
"great game - but the turn of characters has completely ruined my experience. it feels like a weird dating game atp and that alone has left me uncomfortable to play the game, especially after giving me such high hopes at the beginning with so many male characters being introduce. such a shame since this game is beautiful and has a great story."
‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏èüíØüíØüíØ
"i love the game but hate when you spend money for a character they have to change there looks i putting my money cause wanting to support the game and the character design for example of buying a car in a red color they changed it and make it blue color kuro can do better you don't need cn to go higher they just putting you all in leash for not growing, I'll give a 5 star if they make it 18+ and stop censorship people doesn't spend money in game character for story could play 4 stars for story"
best game i have ever played
"Combat and character designs are amazing. Has some running issues and really needs controller support, as playing the combat without it can be trying. I'm really banking on this game coming to Playstation (4) console, I feel like most of my problems with it would be solved once that happens. Otherwise, a very rewarding game. Great compensation given to players, love the echo farming and set up. The ability to skip over dialouge is nice when you just want to plow through a quest. Overall grea!"
Censorship is bad. Characters have been changed after release after players have spent currency to get the character. Unacceptable behaviour from the company
The game is perfect. I started playing the game as soon as it was released and it has came a long way. The newest main quest was quite emotional but it was all worth it. Everything from the characters to music. Every little aesthetic is perfect and the rewards are quite generous.
Great game. üëç
"Well done, Kuro!!"
best for graphic design
Good game. The best one out so far I am actually worried about the employee do they even sleep?
This is absolutely peak I would say it's better than Genshin impact at this point but the censoreship in all over the is crazy man just use censored version of the characters in China and uncensored version to us global players.it feels like the Characters we spent so much time isn't even the same character we summoned for I hope Kuro games would read our or us people's Rating and do something to the censoreship issues I can't stand this anymore
"i love everything, but PLS optimise it i wanna play it smooth af"
Best experience a mobile game can have except it's not really built for mobile Cuz once you see the difference between PC graphics and Mobile you'll definitely want to switch to PC
"Great game, amazing story and characters, amazing mechanics, nice !"
this game is perfect
my experience keeps on getting better and better and this latest patch is no exemption. Wuwa deserves all the praise for being the game that keeps on updating and listens to it's players
"you guys are doing great, but don't let your self change just because some people are not appreciate your work , thanks."
very good monetization in comparison to other games like it definitely doesn't deserve a 16 plus rating I was shocked by that this game is completely safe.
"I have been playing this since this game launches and believe me when I say this... even though it's a gacha game the gameplay and it's story + storytelling is like a ""AAA Game"" And this is a Bonus this devs will really listen to you and they will immediately respond if you have found any bugs and glitches and feedbacks of the game. Definitely worth it to try this game. oh and please spend responsibly!"
absolute peak lesbianism
"10/10 game, f2p friendly, really good endgame content."
game goes 16+ devs panic and replace underwear into grandma bloomers. Amazing.
"I like this game so far. everything is so good..the stories, world building and the rewards. but it's not so smooth in mobiles üòì. I would really appreciate if kuro can make this game a little smoother in mobiles too..like maybe 40fps? üôÇ. Thank you so much"
"amazing game, I genuinely look forward to each update"
look ok just see if going money eater game
Kurogames best gacha company.
Absolutely awesome game! love the gameplay and graphics also the character design is a banger keep on doing the good job Kuro.
peak
"Amazing game, on par with the AAA titles out there. Lovely gameplay,music, and sceneries. The devs actually listen to their player base and improve upon their mistakes."
bro ain't no way I'm not pulling for the cantrella (already pulled her) KURO is cooking this year and cooked and didn't leave us a crumbs. and the 2.2 storyline chiefs kiss frfr KURO really out done there selfs this year and I support them. (please wish me luck on pulling shorekeeper!)
absolute cinema
"I'd wager Wuthering Waves is the definitive open world gacha gaming experience, and both this game and it's team need HONEST reviews now more than ever. Even w/the inclusion of dialogue skip, the story is enthrawling and at times even emotional, the new areas are breathtakingly beautiful and huge but easily traversable, the combat feels intuitive yet challenging in a perfect balance, and the ludicrous effort shaped into the characters and their designs is inspiring. Most of all, it's fun."
"Kuro, if you are reading this, i just want to let you know that there are people who'll try to tarnish and scrutinize your game's attainment which you created to almost perfection, you provided a game design that's extraordinary and fresh to the eyes, please don't listen much to the unnecessary critics and narrow to the constructs instead and focus on what ur goal to bring an amazing experience of gameplay. I believe in your potential and will be supportive of your company's vision, thank you!"
awesome
"I like the story, the combats, and the characters they chosen based on the survey that most players want, the music and the voice actors ""accent"" are absolutely gorgeous especially the cutscenes like you can feel the emotion, the feel of sadness, the anger, and the happiness of every characters. I would say every update has no limits, it keeps improving a lot even though it's a FREE gacha games like I want to become a Rover or being a main character on this game so much, huge W kuro keep it up!"
loving this game
Censored Cantarella after her release but kept it for Carlotta and Roccia. Just for you to understand the problem. The devs drew so called camel toe for those characters. Cantarella has an adult female model while Carlotta has a teenage model and Roccia is loli so the last two literally kids yet they weren't censored unlike an adult one. Either censor it for every character or bring it back.
best gacha open world game with good devs
"Excellent game, good combat, great zone design, lively cutscenes, fairest gacha game compared to the blood sucking competition."
üëç great game with some minor issues
genshin could never
Cool game and list of favorites games
"absolutely the best gaccha game ever. best storyline, best character designs, best sound tracks, everything is soo high end i have never seen any other gaccha game do this...I love you kuro games for making this ‚ù£Ô∏è"
One of the best gacha.
peak 2.2 update is peak the devs listen to players love and soul is poured in the game unlike some other game I know off ehem gi hsr or maybe zzz in the future cough.... anyways this game has much more better QOL than other games in the same genre open world gacha games also gacha rates is much more generous the character 5 star banner is 50/50 but u still have high chance to get it without the pity and signature weapon is 100% guarantee I play in pc btw!
I've been playing this game from patch 1.3. till this day i never got bored of this game whether it's the gameplay or the story everything is perfect for me. I'm playing this game on mobile but I never encountered any lag or fps drop. thank you for creating such a fun and exciting game for me kuro!!
"JUSTICE FOR KURO GAMES ‚úä WE WILL NEVER FORGET WHAT THEY'VE DONE TO YOU ‚úä‚úä ‚úä Ratings wise, great game, wuwa just keeps getting better, not only the environment, quality of life but also the storyline and the devs unwavering efforts for players < 3 M.C being the M.C of his own story. As for THE ISSUES AND RUMOURS SPREADING, IT IS ALL PROPAGANDA BY A GROUP, HECK CHARACTER DESIGNS ARE GORGEOUS and far from what they say comparable to NIKKE design, heck it is not even close to NIKKE level üóø"
one of the best game I have ever played. the combat is satisfying. can't wait for the new characters to come.
2.2 peak cinema! Cantarella MVP! Triple Rover Final Battle! Rover having more voice is appreciated üëç It would be awesome to see this kinda improvement going forward
auto dc ...
"Maganda yung game para sa akin panalo ang combat system at graphic nia, kaya 3 lng star binigay ko kc pang flagship yung required na chipset niya para ma abot ang high graphics at resolution at ang pinaka na dissapointed ako isa yung ang tagal nag story telling niya hindi pa ma skip every quest may storytelling na hindi ma skip üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°üò°"
just amazinggggggg
meh
Amazing game amazing story amazing characters designs. Very time friendly doesn't require too much attention. Complex mechanics but fun to use very immersive gameplay. Overall good game.
They betrayed the players by altering a character already released and players have paid for.
"I love it. There's just many things u need to improve. The map, expecially when tracking, it should show an arrow pointing up or down dirrection so we would know where exactly we need to go. Also the AOE of pick up should be expanded. Most of the times we need to stand right exactly in at the spot to collect or absorb items. U shiuld expand it so we can easily collect or absorb without have ng to be at the spot"
"I really appreciate the game, just maybe dark skinned would look super good with these graphics!"
One of the best gacha games I've ever played.
Best gameplay I have seen
Best..BEST..game..EVERüíû
"I love this game, I really enjoy it to the point. There are no words to describe how amazing the game is. It's better than any other gacha game out there, like wise play this game"
"My friend Jojo's the one who recommended me to play this game, when i tried it, it was bizarre especially the adventure part, one of the best games ever."
nice üëçüèª
"Please restore the original design of Cantarella and Fleurdelys, they look so bad. I'm sure you can find a better solution than censoring them. Look at Snowbreak and GFL2, they even have a more tempting detail and scene at 12+ rating. I'm sure you can too, kuro... DELIVER WHAT YOU PROMISED!."
This was an experience
finally my main account have first legendary swords
I love this it's more than genshin impact
absolute cinema
unplayable on my phone.
"overall it's really good, the qualities, graphics and the performance are great too. the mechanics and story is beginner friendly so it's easy to grasp, especially if you played other rpg, MMORPG etc in the past. but I've been having an issue lately. every time I log in and play it after a minute the signal goes wrong and keeps lagging then hang even tho I'm already near my wifi, my wifi is good and my signal too so idk why it keeps doing that. I can't play properly for some time now."
censorship. game has gambling mechanics. legal age for gambling in the United States is 21+. (this company targets underage gambling)
"great game however be careful devs have now changed a gacha characters look post release with zero warning, announcement, compensation or addressed the issue. they have also changed a bosses design with none of these things either. I am very disappointed by this and it makes me worried about future characters and past characters if they are doing this now. I would suggest not spending money until Kuro addresses this issue as that is what I'm planning on doing"
it's a amazing gameüéÆ
"I love the game immensely. The MC is acting like a real MC, who is amazingly well-written and powerful! The visuals are amazing, the characters look beautiful, and the stories of every patch are just a chef's kiss! Not to mention that even some of the older limited five star characters are still powerful until today and not powercreeped immensely. (e.g. Jiyan and Yinlin etc.) Kuro's improved so much!"
"this is actually best game ever I played but, these lagging are more but however keep up KURO ‚ù§"
Great for high end devices but not so much for slower devices like older pcs or slow/old phones. Nevermind somehow my phone no longer blows up when I play.
"4 stars. good combat style, graphics : eh... for my device, good sceneries, the only problem i face is that its frame drops r very high, like it goes form 60-37 or even 20 sumtimes (it needs some fix on frame drop issues).Now 5stars"
nice game
Hand down best looking game in Mobile. it have very beautiful graphic and Animations. the combat are so fun and engaging.
I really really really really really love this game every thing including graphics combat adventure mmo world built and every thing about wuthering waves is amazing please make an lite version so that I can enjoy it is more better fps my low end phone can't handle it.
good job.
this is the best exploring open world and fighting game better than gamimshn impact
"sadly this game have unbalanced gender ratio. There are alot of female characters and less male characters. I don't particularly have any problem with female characters and their fan service, but come on is it so hard to release a cool looking male character every 2 patch?. If you are here looking for a game with balanced or decent ratio and less fan service then this game is not for you."
"they will ninja nerve the feature of any character, not worth it"
pretty dope
"kuro kocak.. sensor busuk, buat apa ratingnya 16+ kalo harus dirubah, dari awal gausah mancing""ama desain karakter yg nyeleneh, tau gitu mending gausah balik main game ini kalo kena sensor.."
"I've been playing it for quite a while and enjoying it severly, the story is magnificent, and the characters are entertaining. The battles are awesome. It's the first time that I used the Male MC as my main, I hope that there will be outfits for the Rovers."
I love this game.
"I LOVE WUTHERING WAVE. But please can you fix the laggy for mobile user. Every time I fight monster, The game when lagging and cannot move."
this game is sucks im trying to play this game is so lag plss optimize this game or i quit this game
this is so good but I think need some more like Genshin Impact bright beautiful world not like some black night please make a like Genshin Impact beautiful world and bright and not tragedy story and not die character any character
Really good game but takes so much of my CPU
"suddenly I can't open the game it's stuck saying ""the gateway connection time out"" I just played 8 hours ago and now it didn't let me play please help"
So far the devs seem to care and listen to the players
"the graphics in this game are absolutely gorgeous, and even if sometimes I get a bit of lag it's quickly fixed and I don't think it's the game's fault. I think the exploration in Wuthering Waves is the best I've ever experienced and the grapple and flight features make it incredibly easy and relaxing for me, also the unlimited sprint. I find the gacha system to be good as well with the max pity being 80 and weapon banner getting it's own wishes. over all, I recommend playing it‚ô•"
"Money spent actually gets reinvested into the game. 10/10 company, 10/10 game"
"Been enjoying this game since launch, but recently whenever I try to log in, the loading bar stops at 75%. It keeps doing that, even when I clear cache and restart my phone. I dunno if it's on my end or if it's the game's optimization issues, but I'm gonna try Uninstalling and restarting the game to see if this issue sorts itself out."
just Cencored the whole game so we can see only pixels ü§¨
the game is great but the optimization not too great compared to genshin it's run smoother even in high graphics but this game isn't that optimize on moderate end phone like mine so hopefully you fix this because it's almost unplayable (fyi: I don't play low because it's terrible I want a realistic look even though my phone is dying)
A wonderful game that put Qanchen in a very critical situation
Honestly one of the best gacha games to play out there. Overall really good.
"New update refuses to let me login to my account, keeps telling me there's a login error. The thought of losing my progress and money I've spent is discouraging"
"The game looks promising but I have a game breaking issue, my phone overheats a lot when I play, the game lags and crashes soon after, I've tried every optimization setup I could think of to solve the issue but it hasn't worked so far, it's so frustrating because I've got my first limited character I can't build them nor explore the map because of this issue."
"Good combat is unquestionable, but the story is. Expositions. ""Spectacle over Substance"". Got better in 2.0, then next versions ruined the pacing again. Cinematics are good, but it feels more like a spectacle after all the boring expositions. And as time goes on, this feels more like a waifu collector with how our protag is an OP god with the girlies drooling at us. Every stories so far are just overused tropes. Shallow. Hate it. Had potential, trusted Kuro cuz of PGR, then they flopped both."
weak si ed
"give it a try, it's really good"
Very fun gameplay and awesome character designs.
God tier game with peak story. 2.2 Cartethiya story is the best of all
good game
"I love the game, but I hate it when Male Rover's dialogue answers are very different from Female Rover's. That's not fair I guess, I mean Male Rover are like incels"
not as good as genshin...maybe second place
better than genshin
"HOLY! this game is very very good for an open world game fan, as a day one and pre-registered player I can say that this game deserves a round of applause üëè this game is very good with character designs to maps and quests. You can have a blast with your friends in combat or some relaxing open world. By far, AERO ROVER is my fav! He's so cool and so are the other characters. I think you should give this game a tryüíô"
"everything is perfect but the problem is game blurry or foggy type graphics pls try to improve the graphics quality... when I zoom out I don't even see the character face, body clearly due to blurry graphics.pls try to enhance the graphics quality and textures etc. thanks"
I do love this game but it keeps crashing for me even though I have lots of spare storage and my device is updated regularly
not enough male characters
Gooner game. But hypocrite to male characters. Hope it turns into Alchemy Stars.
"Copy of genshin but worse, rewards are better but the gacha system is same."
perfect game
"please optimize the game, it starts to lag when there are too many enemies. I have 8s gen 3 but it lags even in the lowest setting. I have sent the report to the official site but it has been more then 3 weeks and they haven't replied till now."
"mobile experience is worst high ping rate at SEA server can't do TOA,WhiWa so lag stutters are worst it was ok a last 2.0 now can't play it"
I have not played the game I tried to play it but I am not going to wait 17 hours for a game to download 17.46gb of data just to play it that is ridiculous
"I really like the game, the characters and its stories, but there's something I think the devs should add that is the option to delete past mission resources, this way it would make the game more accessible to play for players who don't have much storage on their devices!"
Best Gacha game ever made
"Quite an exceptional and generous gacha game. The devs listen to player feedback. Though some fighting mechanisms are difficult to execute on mobile, it's not a deal breaker. Summon rates are reasonable, I've been playing since day 1, haven't spent a penny and still have a decent collection of 5 star characters and weapons."
One of the best than others
The game is great! and the story is also pretty cool. the character designs are PEAK and their gameplay is also peak each of the chearacters have their own unique style of gameplay and design
"The game looks promising. Very high quality , its only the beggining and the story already got me hooked."
nice keep everything censored or just Don't make games
Great
make a cloud for this game pls
Amazing üòç
"Literally one of the, if not thebest gacha game I have ever played. Qol in this game is very very refreshing üëå"
best gacha game ever!!!
"I‚Äôve been loving Wuthering Waves so far. The gameplay, visuals, and story are amazing. But I really hope the devs reconsider the 24-hour cooldown for changing the Rover‚Äôs appearance. As someone who deeply immerses in the game and prefers a certain character presentation to stay connected, being locked into a gender I‚Äôm uncomfortable with completely breaks the experience. It made progressing through the story feel forced instead of enjoyable..."
"really interesting game mechanics and a engaging story, definitely keeping me more entertained than other games of this type"
Whimper Waves makes me want to jump off a bridge and end my life.
i love it but sadly my device doesn't support it so it crashes a lot
"best gacha game so far, I loved it üòôüíó"
"great game with several great stuff ,but i don't like that it's an open world exploration game and sometimes that the game design can be a little dark(I don't know how to describe it) but great game none the less"
"The game is good, but there is a serious issue with the server. I chose the recommended server before starting the game. Now I face connection issues every time I play. I am playing with internet speed of 250mbps. Really disappointed."
THE BEST GACHA GAME EVER TO EXIST!! if your someone who wanna try out a gacha game this is it i downloaded wuthering wawes bcz i was interested in the story and oh boy oh boy they did not dissapoint they have been doing what players exactly wanted for the past year (its been an yearsince the game released)if you dont trust this random guy typing this out wich you shoudnt trust strangers . go to youtube and watch acouple of wuwa content creators they have been loving the games this game is cinema
after the recent update it's back to it's old lagging self.
nice
Game is good but playing on mobile makes it hard because of lag and crashing.
the game is good
"2.2 is phenomenal at story telling and fun short patch. Still had some bits of issues here and there but overall it's lived up to its hype. 2.3 coming soon, see you all there!! Much love!!"
"the recent censorship is just dumb. You're not Mihoyo, Kuro."
KURO DESERVE MORE THAN 5 STAR
"Although I left this game for months, I've decided to finish Act 1 to catch up more contents."
"ever since the game came out for pre registration I played, through both rough and the good. the game constantly improved with devs listening to it community felt very refreshing making me want to support the company more. Now days the game feels more like AAA game, graphics are absolutely stunning."
excellent üëçüëç
This game is awful. tooamy fights and cutscenes even stronger enemies in the quest what makes me stock in some quest because the enemies are too strong to defeat. better to quit coz its not fun playing.
censoring stuff without warning
"I've been playing Wuthering Waves since launch and It's been the best game I've ever played and it's my favourite! Though I don't have many limited characters, it's still super nice to play, and the storyline is good in my personal opinion. 2.2 is so far my favourite version, I love how nice the designs are, along with the map and story"
GENSHIT IMPACT COULD NEVER
"censorship is bad, would not spending money on it again üëé"
MC at this game are peak üî•üî•üî•
it would be great if you release it on xbox consoles too.
revert the visual changes that's been done on canterella!! we want the og canterella back (no need to bring back the multiple party bug)
Remove waifus and husbando's and focus solely on making a good story instead. Kuro you have the potential to be different from the mainstream gacha rpg's and set examples for the future of this genre. Pls stop focusing to satisfy the normie audiences and make the game good in general and set the bar high for upcoming games.
"Best Game I Have Ever Played, Best Story So Far, Amazing Cutscenes, And Even The Animatics Are So Sick As Hell. I Really Appreciate Kuro For This Amazing Achievement, Although I Have Bit Of Suggestion To Kuro And The Devs, Despite From All The Rewards They Give Us. Still Kuro Is Doing A Really Great Job Of Making Their Players Happy and Enjoying The Game. Keep This Up Kuro! :D"
Peak cinema story. It's the best game out there rn.
still downloading cant play been waiting to finish the downloading sources been 8 hours since
okok
the best gacha game I've ever played
"man it's really sad what's happening to you guys, ik you're doing insane work and i hope you can solve this problem, love you guys keep up the good work."
Def. one of the best
absolutely love this game
great game try it
THIS GAME SHOULD WIN THE GAME OF THE CENTURY!! in mobile ofcourse
Amaizing game 10/10. The only feedback I can think of is making gliders accessible in the 1.0 area or adding some kind of traversal mechanic similar to it. Devs have also shown that they're willing to listen to their player base.
"Censoring after people were pulling the character, i should have known better(:"
Please please please üôè let us to change gender. That would be amazing üòç (they did it omg ‚ô•Ô∏è)
10/10 Jellyfish Woman
I like it
"One of the most fun combat gacha games ive ever played, dodge and parry mechanics are nice and fun addition to the gameplay. Bosses are fun to fight well some, while they are difficult especially in the later part of the game aka holograms the satisfaction i felt as ive beaten difficulty 6 is immense. Gacha system is solid especially the weapon banner with a guranteed pity system. Generous devs that listens. Story had a slow start but it gets super good later on. Ps. Shorekeeper Wife ma now"
worse Game
normally i really like this game and i would definitely give 5 star but censorship is really rubs me the wrong way if you gonna make the game +16 why would you censor it kuro? this really left a bad taste in my mouth sorry but I will not change my review until the censorship go
yay!
w game
Generous and a really amazing game!!!
I love this game so much! a player since Launch. And the best thing that it was released on my birthday ü§≠
PLEASE DON'T CENSURE THE GAME!!! üò≠
2nd review: All goods but hope make it balance in gender cz it really doesn't make sense that noble women r the one who is fixing the issue and conflict instead of a man.
one of best anime hack & slash of all time reforged base with soul series game this game is must to play for anime fans and dmc players
"without a doubt, the best mobile game, and it's not even close. farming fatigue definitely beginning to creep in."
this game has nice character attacks and patterns with unique ability and dodge and counter attack but there is still a problem this game LAG so much if down your all graphics still game lag and overheating your mobile and they not solving the Lagging issue
"I'd get this a high rate, since I can't help but to admire all the resonator, the story line, the animation, voice actor, and the world design. I am in love with this game, and I wouldn't get bored that easley."
"great game, very fun to play"
"This game is better than genshin impact and in the category of gacha games I love this game so much. For realistic graphics, missions, exploration of all regions and most I liked the fight skills of the characters. Thanks for creating this fantastic game. Keep it up in the future like this only kuro games."
game is great and mechanic very smooth üî•üî•üî•
"Pengalaman bermain yang sangat menarik dan banyak fitur¬≤ yang memudahkan player ketika explore map seperti lari di tebing atau graple, grafis sudah sangat baik, alur cerita epik, combat sistem keren. overall sangat puas dengan game nya. Saran : Lebih di permudah dalam menang gacha 50/50, karna banyak yang mengeluhkan selalu kalah rate off. Terimakasih"
"Far better than genshin impact in many aspects,the best devs in the whole gaccha space because they fricking listen to players. WuWa is better in aspects like - Implementing Player suggestions ex echo load outs. Better exploration. Ex: grapple,flight, Excellent combat mechanics Emersive game modes. Ex: holograms. Garenteed weapon on weapon banner and 80 max pity,Quick bug fixes,Better compensation for bug fixes I Can go on but these are the main points I just love this game"
"INSANE!!...... the animation, music, story, character design and detail. The combat is just amazing I love everything so far can't get enough."
An excellent game. I can't wait for more updates.
"decent story, great graphics, fun combat, and unique char. One massive problems tho, the optimization is still really really really bad. Its not even about device issues, i use snp 8 elite and can barely keep the fps stable at 50 average. The settings? i keep it at medium mind you and its still not stable at all. How about lowest graphics? same thing, can barely keep it at 54 fps average and the phone is NOT even hot. I dont even understand how the optimization is this bad, its baffling"
better than genshin must play no details needed
"Better than other games. Devs listen to the players. Great playstyle, case in point, parry and dodge systems. MC is OP and freaking playable unlike you-know-what."
been playing since launch every day playing and now with recent patch ccp had censorship the new character cantarella and the weekly boss plz don't let them dumbass kids ruin characters designs and go the route other gachas game did plz revert the censorship kuroüò≠
ok
why my two account suddenly disappear? why... now i need to play again from the start...
"I haven't tried this game on Mobile as much. But god damn this game is the best Gacha game. Played since launch, it was really rough, yet i persevered. What followed was the biggest masterpiece, by artists that could careless about monetary gain but for the love of the community. Thank you Kuro ü•π"
love but please more calcharo content üòûüòûüôè
"friendly with f2p we can enjoy as people buy, but need more men characters"
"everything is amazing. besides when you are forced into a quest, had to skip through lore due to that which made me rather upset. see, it kept switching me to the trial resonator in this city area. see I had another quest I wanted to do before, but I couldn't due to it switching me to the trial resonator. this was during the diamond crystal girl with the cute guns's like story or friendship quest."
"Great game. Great story. Incredible graphics. I love all about this game, starting with the incredible story and details other games don't care about. I love that the game isn't a game for kids and it's actually a pegi 16 game, and developers are crazy, never seen developers like that who actually care about feedbacks. Every game has his bad things but this game has very little of them. 5 stars for sure."
better than genshin
"Best gacha game of all time, day 1 player, never stopped playing and never will."
The game is good but needs arabicsupport.
I like it...could make much more optimization to reduce heating up ..apart from that it's crisp
The best experience I've had with a gacha game. It resembles an AAA game so much that it is mind-blowing how it is free. I highly recommend it.
good game
It's way better then I imagined yet still need some optimization its playable the main thing sucks here is it's draining a lot of battery overall it's pretty great
good game with good graphics
I will revert back the ratings after the censorship problem is solved.
Endgame content can be hard to complete but doesn't feel forced since you get plenty of rewards elsewhere. It's definitely one of the best gacha games out there right now.
I don't have any good phone but overall this game is killer.
wuwa is perfect thanks alot we r grateful
love the game and the hard work put into this but do you think its ok in some distant update you could make the piano that shorekeeper has playable
OVERALL THIS GAME IS GOOD THE STORY 2.0 QOL AND THE WORLD DESIGN IS TOP TIER ITS LIKE AAA GAME GAME FIRST GATCHA 2ND
"Absolutely amazing game! I've been playing since the launch day and have had zero issues with the game on my phone. Everything ‚Äî from the character designs to the environment designs as well as the gameplay ‚Äî is just fantastic! Am enjoying playing it very much and would definitely recommend to everyone. Looking forwards to the future of the game! Edit: Changing to 1 star because of recent censorships, will change it back to 5 stars once censorship is removed."
seru
"Genial! Es maravilloso, las animaciones son fant√°sticas, los personajes tienen un dise√±o incre√≠ble, el ambiente y los paisajes son una maravilla. Todo! No hay powercreep y es muy F2P friendly, pero como los desarrolladores escuchan tanto a la comunidad y te dan tanto, te dar√°n hasta ganas de apoyar el juego y hacer un tarjet√≥n de vez en cuando üòÅ La historia es fant√°stica tambi√©n y la exploraci√≥n muy fluida y entretenida. No tiene un pero. Recomendado al 100%"
Best Gatcha game i ever played it perfect
"The game and graphics are top-notch, and the story is just goated. The main character is amazing , but the dev should optimize the game both on pc and mobile, especially for mobile."
"I've played many gacha/mobile games to know that once a censorship, it will lead to another and another in the long run, and thus I'm quitting before my investment in the game goes to waste for all the money and time I spent to get the new characters that I wanted to play, to later feel completely disappointed."
good game
the best gacha game you can play in 2025
"just nice, it's healing my past rpg truama (expt that i kept on losing) but still nice, devs that can listen to players are so refreshing."
"Still waiting for the switch server, But I love your game"
Full star. Cause too many hoyoshit fans using censorship as an excuse to give one star.
why did kuro update the minimum age limit and then censor their characters.. Bruh I paid for the characters and I dont like that products I paid for are changed for the worse or short changed. EDIT: I hope kuro gets past this obstacle which is the false accusations they have been getting and restore the wrongfully forced censorship force upon by haters.
tame your jiggle physics üôÑ
good game
it good
"Overall udah bagus game nya, cuman ya menurut gw mode Coop masih harus di kembangin lagi, Karena mode Coop hampir tidak bisa ngapa ngapain, aku sama temen ku main Coop malah saling bengong jadinya karena kekurangan event atau sesuatu yang special di Coop? Mungkin hologram challenge di buat jadi bisa di mainkan di mode Coop hanya saja stats boss nya menjadi naik ketika di mainkan di mode Coop, jadi itu bisa membutuhkan kerja sama dan asik untuk dimainkan di Coop bersama teman!"
"I love the game ALOT and want to play it but there's just there are just some problems those need to be fixed (I hope they will be fixed) yeah so first thing that my games keeps crashing even though my phone is great and I got a lot of space and stuff and the other is scrolling down everytime to see the message and one more thing that there's a ""compiling shaders"" glitch after every update that while comipling shaders my screen turns black kinda and stays like that until I load the game."
BEST GAME EVER
"i don't know man, this is just like a better version of genshin. when there is genshin doesn't have this game have it. Idk what to say but tis game is good af"
optomize it more
best game I ever played
keep cooking kuro!!! don't mind those inc3ls who complain about the censorship!!!
Fantasy Version of Punishing Gray Raven
Exceptional ‚ú®
Why are there so many women characters? I hope you change the genre. Cuz I've been bait since the first release cuz of the males characters.
bro I love it so much . the story is goat . this game is better than gaishin impact story
"I just have one question. why is there Only three limited 5 star male characters and 100 billion other girls as 5 stars and 4 stars ever since release? it almost been a whole year. I was so excited for this game and I liked it's style, but I quit for good, the repeated type of characters is BORING and it's becoming another boring game of an all girl characters serviced for One type of fans, I'm utterly disappointed. Get better."
"Great Story telling, Great Combat Mechanic, Best of the Best."
better than genshin
good game.
nevermind the haters. i love this game
Loved the game since 1.0‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
it is best I've ever played this year keep up growing kuro!!
normal gaming experience
well they deserve it
"Really liked the game because of great fighting mechanism, exploring features, rewards are satisfying, scenery & world building is very nice, story is very good. The only thing I have problem is with small font of game if possible pls give the setting to adjust the ingame font like dialogues, etc. Otherwise game is fire to play üî•"
"Really well done game. At the beginning of the game the game have some faults but they have been improving in every version. I really hope you keep working as much as you been doing. You have a great game with amazing inmersion, music and story, characters design for far the best I've seen in gacha mages. Totally recomended."
co op mode needs some improvement can't even go past a door in co op mode
"Wuthering Waves is hands down one of the best games I‚Äôve played on mobile. Everything about it is just perfect‚Äîthe graphics are stunning, the combat is smooth and satisfying, and the story pulls you in from the start. The open world is beautifully crafted and full of life, with tons to explore. Controls are intuitive, and performance is great even on mid-range devices. You can tell a lot of care went into every detail. Huge props to the devs for delivering such an amazing experience. Highly reco"
gacor
Please make the font larger on mobile.
fantastic open world action RPG
so disappointed on the censorship made
judaya yomon qotadi internet yaxshi ishlasayam o'yindan chuqarvpradi
"Unfair Backlash from Non-Players Wuthering Waves is a great game with amazing visuals and gameplay. Sadly, it's being targeted by people posing as concerned parents who clearly don't play it. Their mass complaints seem aimed at sabotaging Kuro Games' success, not offering real feedback. As a paying player, it's frustrating to see the game penalized because of this. Real fans appreciate the effort behind it‚Äîhope Kuro keeps pushing forward."
i'm honestly so disappointed with the direction this game is heading... shouldn't have marketed as an open world game if you're just trying to be a suggestive galge game smh üòî
"good bosses but grinding is tedious and not enjoyable and new bosses don't have many parryable attacks or either don't do them which literally defeats a the purpose of having a parry mechanic and parry timing between characters are inconsistent I can parry hecate whip attack with other character but if I use carlotta now the entire timing has changed because her attack animation plays differently, it would have been better to have a separate parry button instead of the attack"
I love this game so much guarantee 5 stars weapon unlike the other games I don't want to mention about it and also this game is much lighter to play it's more likely an extra time consuming game.The most important part of it are the characters which are amazing and impressive most of them are solid to use but I love shorekeeper I'm a shorekeeper's dog.
Just a beautiful experience to play
Can't play this game in mobile data & No luck(losing every 50/50 with soft/hard pity)
You guys should have stayed 12+ and not bothered with 16+ change. Everything is gonna get censored anyway. So disappointed. Gameplay is still good tho.
Instead of actually addressing issues they released a character then after its banner almost came to its end and then they censored the character for global instead of just doing it locally. Shady business practices here we go
BEST GAME EVERrrr
"Great game with amazing potential, but it seriously needs better optimization. I'm using a Dimensity 8200 Ultimate with 24GB RAM, yet the game still lags, stutters, and causes overheating. It‚Äôs frustrating that such high specs can‚Äôt run it smoothly. Please improve graphics settings and overall performance for both PC and mobile. Smooth gameplay should be the top priority. I love the concept and visuals, but stability must come first. Hope future updates fix this soon!"
fix lag on low end device its so hard to play
Best game ever!
good game
best gacha game (maybe)
"The game was good but by now you can tell that the developers have decided to just throw the entire game away and instead aim to create a game for misogynistic porn addicts and it makes the game and community unbearable. The women are designed to be like sex dolls for men with a bland self-insert MC, and their characters are written to fit into men's sex fantasies, like why would you make a female character with a camel toe who acts like a trad wife. It's just getting depressing at that point."
It is the best game I ever played in my life it is so realistic and the story is so fun and interesting also I love the character..I hope I will see more of new things is this game I'm give a 5 star bro the game is üî•üî•
2.2 version supergood thumbsup
amazing keep it up devs
"After playing the game for quite a few hours now I can confidently say WuWa has engaging combat mechanics and movement, beautiful world with an amazing soundtrack. The story starts slow but improves over time. However, performance is a MAJOR ISSUE. Frequent stutters happen even on low settings, including during cutscenes. My phone handles Genshin and PUBG on mid-high settings with no problem, so optimization needs serious work. Fix that, and this game could be one of the best on mobile."
best game ever
great cinematic and storylines
i love it
"Was a decent game, but because of the recent censorship , I can't give this game a good rating. Kuro should give refunds for anybody who gave them money or revert the censorship. Those are the only choices they have."
the game is very fun and dynamic. 1.0 was kind of ehhh. but they have been leveling up their ways each and every patch. A beautiful game that has revitalized my love for open world
i am satisfied with the game. way to go devs!
"Technical stuff 5/10 Gameplay 10/10 Story 7/10 (bit confused with character name) Character 10/10 (sheesh what a beautiful creation) Despite a rough launch, worth to try i guess"
"Amazing games, amazing character design, amazing experience while playing Wuthering Waves. This game really exceed my expectations. Good job Kuro games."
it's very good
Please be kind on my pity wuwa
"Amazing story, characters, gameplay and environment. Also PLEASE Kuro bring back Fleurdelys underwear, the app was mass reported for its ""nudity."" We want the censorship reverted and her to have undies on again"
Love it
"I'm OBSESSED with this game especially for zani, omg I already see the leaks n I think ik where my money is going... highly recommend!! I play gi too n usually I got 4 wishes per day cz I'm lazy n on wuwa i got 10 wishes per day! I love LOVE this game already, the lore, gameplay, EVERYTHING about this game. n on 2 weeks I already got 89 wishes ü§Ø ( I only get few cz like I said I'm lazy )"
the story is starting to gitgut
it better than anticipated
love this game
BEST GAME EVER!!!!
generous game
Censorship waves. Blatantly censored Canterella and Fleurdelys without telling the playerbase.
nice game
"1 star for taking 1 hour in compiling shader and crashing, lagging during that and having the worst loading screen sequence with daily 200mb download for god sake (my wifi is totally fine but it takes forever) then it has to compile shaders every time it downloads the 200mb. Mobile players already had enough problems running the game but the shader is the most annoying one (I'll edit the review once it gets fixed. I'm just so done with the game taking an hour and a half just to open)"
Censorship is bad
"everything about this game is masterpiece new edit , censorship is bad kuro , don't be Genshin you Will loss your fans , maybe you don't know but you already in a war between Ananata and NTE and Arknight Endfield, do not lose to them by making your fanbase Angry with ridiculous Censorship"
"this game is PEAK with good storyline,good gameplay,good service just hope the optimization for low end and mid end phone become much better so more people can enjoy the game"
keeps crashing on fist boss
where are the male characters
Why the heck are the challenges so damn hard...no bloody character lineup is able to beat the Hard mode...why dont u guys turn down the difficulty of the challenges a little bit
"Truly love the game, I can feel dev really put heart and soul onto making this masterpiece"
good üíï‚ú®
"It is a good game for those who like arpg, it is a bit like playing monster hunter (like remembering enemies fighting patterns), it is mostly all about your own skills, the story can be a lot better but overall is good. Oh, and they have too many females characters right now, hopefully males can be increased in the future"
the fan service is Really gross and off-putting. tone it down.
best game
"- so many QOL changes. Its like every patch, a new QOL is always added. G game could never. - great story improvement. Version 2.0 has so far exceeded my expectations when it comes to storystelling. - very generous with freebies. Its like every patch even as a f2p, you get 80+ pulls per patch. GI could never. - characters having their own unique animations, unlike that certain G game that still keeps reusing the same animations for weapon showcase. GI could never."
"-update- I loved the game, much better than genshin, and im playing both games. i do genshin just to finish daily primogems, and this becomes laborous, but for this game, i tend to stay and enjoy the events, this account is luckier and i spend lessers money in this game than genshin. but i got more 5 star characters and their weapons just doing event quests to get my pulls and spending some monthly subs. I hate it that the chinese genshin community is pulling some shady things."
"I m very admired in the beginning, especially this version story is very impressive. But currently they followed Mihoyo way style already, character design have been nerf."
"The game is great, but there's a major drawback‚Äîplayers can't collect materials or rewards together in the same world unless they invite friends. Even then, the invited friend doesn't receive any rewards unless they're just helping, which makes the co-op experience feel unbalanced and unsatisfying. It‚Äôs disappointing to call it a co-op game when the gameplay feels unfair and disconnected. What many of us want is a game where we can truly play together, participate in events as a team, and enjoy"
nice üëçüôÇ
Best open world gacha game ever
"Used to play Genshin (Been playing that since release) and I didn't waste time switching over to WuWa, it's just way better and perfected overall. I love the open world areas, they are really scenic and beautiful, the combat is the major factor for me and this game just nails it perfectly, the movement, the combos we can pull off, just everything... I really love it. I recommend anyone searching for an open world game to just start playing this especially if you're fed up with Genshin's BS."
"What's the point of increasing the age rating if you add stupid censorship into the game soon after? Congrats kuro, you just destroyed players trust and goodwill, my wallet is completely shut for your product from now on."
remove censorship
"Nice animations, story, characters, and world building everything is perfect in this game I've always tried finding a game that has a very good story and I did found one, It's this game."
what a piece of art
"The game improvements are quite good, but it is very unfortunate why the grass for mobile users is so bad compared to other games, I hope there are improvements for the grass because it adds a good impression and comfort in playing the game."
it's fine
The game's exceptional graphics and fluid fighting mechanics deliver a smooth and action-packed experience.
Gameplay and graphics are top tierüíØ
ü§ç
I loved how the graphics and supporting the low device
Laggs on a 2024 Samsung tablet after 2 minutes of playing. I ave all settings optimized for performance and plugged in and its literally unplayable. FIX THE ANDROID OPTIMIZATIONS ALREDY(don't get me started on PC performance) It is only playable on iOS for some reason
"Revert the censorship! Censorship is never good, as i said don't shy away from showing fanservice in you're characters and characters skins. Showing fanservice a little or a lot is never not a good thing, especially since you're game just got updated to 16+"
Basically need some more improvements like optimize the game every released a new version so many players should not complaint and more ingame rewards
"I love the game but I wish it was a bit more optimized for mobiles, the outlines of the characters are quite pixelated"
Can i get Burmese language? ü•≤
(Mobile) Everyday I open the game to play the loading always has this Compiling Shader which takes areound 5-10mins.
"I do not recommend playing this game. The developers are dishonest. They change/censor character appearance AFTER you spend money getting them. They refuse to apologize, offer explanations or a refund. Better to stay away if you don't want to get misled."
"This is now my No. 1 gacha game! Tbh, I appreciate everything about it plus Kuro listens! I hope WuWa will become more successful cause why not? It's the best."
till nowbest gacha game experience but it still requires some improvement
No words. It's just good. Like really good.
the wave isnt so wuthering with the recent ninja censorship without addressing it
Why did you guys decide to censor Cantarella and Fleurdelys?? We don't want this to become Genshin!
best music and story telling and even the characters and their combat is really intriguing. ‚ù§Ô∏è
soon as I downloaded it had to wait almost 2 hours to download updates *mind you I'm on high speed wifi * then once everything is done I tried to play the game but soon as it gets to the main screen it kept crashing smh fix your game can't even play it üôÑ
tsuki üòç
best game i'd ever play
"Can't even start the game on my phone, I deleted it and redownload it multiple times, I hope I can still get my pre registered rewards I'll have to see on my computer."
"The amount of people complaining about censorship and how it's 'not acceptable in the west' is hilarious. It is an Eastern company and probably got a slap on the wrist much like Genshin and had no control over it. They even have stated that they are allowed to change the designs. You still have your back breaking women with no chest support, get over yourselves, you almost never see that anyways actually playing. It is a very beautiful game with good graphics and is easy to survive f2p."
"Game keeps improving. Congratulations to the whole team for making it this far. They proved all the ""EOS"" rumors wrong. So far, the best gacha game out there."
graet
"This overall for me has been amazing but needs many improvements like Better co-op, better optimization this is a big one. One more thing I would like to add is the addition of the fps meter since I wanna know how well my device is performing and at what settings to play. Overall optimization has gotten a bit better and still needs a lot of improvement."
we promise we deliver
PEAK
genshin but dark souls
Censorship is bad. You lost my faith and respect and I will not be spending anymore money on wuthering waves and instead on games like Snowbreak and zzz.
Noice
great
Yall keep your account details safe otherwise it'll be hard to get it back. FYI CUSTOMER CARE DOESN'T PROVIDE MUCH or ANY AT ALL BECAUSE THEY CANT/WONT HELP YOU. Want proof check out Reddit Customer Care/Kuro Games
Kuro games please revert the censorship I Hated censor I Pulled for Cantarella and her weapon because of your marketing and now you censor her and the game. Please revert the changes.
"censored, good game otherwise"
"Best gacha game but needs more Male characters, also the one thing I'm disappointed from is Fan Service for male audience"
excellent
everything is amazing about this game! no single complaint! best mobile game ever
"amazing Game! one of the best games in this genre...or maybe the best! the gameplay,story,characters and the world are so good, it's better than I imagined...it's even better than genshin impact I hope kuro games keeps improving the game!"
"still can't play the game in my potato phone. But still play it regularly on onetap, one of my fav game along with Wizardry."
Censorship sucks.
Very good combat mechanics
Devs actually listen to the community
"Censorship is bad and always will be, this isn't a game for kids and it never was. kuro you can do better than this."
"Character models are God tier amazing,the world is beautiful Wonderful exploration mechanics and amazing parry dodge fight mechanics it's a wonderful experience"
Best gacha in the world rn but plese add more male characters
Peak gaming dont let other reviews fool you
I like the game a lot. Especially now with the PS5 version out.
"Unfortunately, I have to change my review to 1-star since the developers have started falsely advertising their character designs and changing them after purchase. Another game that censored products they sell on global servers after purchase. They need to separate the Global and CN servers before you can trust any of your purchases in this game."
"what an incredible game. loved it, it will definitely grow bigger"
"its became good the qol improvement in this game its different, major upgrade story, huge improve on music and environment. I have low end phone (garbage) in term of optimization low end device definitely need improvement but its clearly tell this game not mean to play on low end phone just buy better phone"
best game ever
great game
"Perfect, this game is damn near perfect 10/10."
"from 5 star to 1 star, they start to censor their design... no investment for sure. disgusting, pathetic no longer a mature game instead kindergarten baby game same as genshit.In the end they follow genshit path.I gonna quitting soon. they censor characters design, I censor my cash and investing"
"absolute cinema, just pls dont let powercreeping too much"
"hmm, i like this game, hasn't pressure for daily like other open world game (GI), perfect for chill open world lover like me, but?? the optimization is very bad, if u don't use high-end smartphone or pc, u will get absolute frame drop even if u use very low grapichüòí"
"really decent game but pls kuro, make more male characters. because its not wuthering waves anymore it gathering wivesüò≠üò≠ but tbh make more male characters/resonators"
Man I Got My First 5 Star Camella On My 30th Pull!!!!
"The only good review I will ever write in my life, only because the every dish they cook it masterpiece. I'll savor them each at its fullest.... Keep cooking and keep bringing the masterpieces one which is better than last one... Love from rover...."
"This game has amazing potential and compared to it's rival genshin it has fairly less content than it because ofc it came out only in may last year and considering the one year mark, this is much better than genshin. There are some problems i have been having and would be glad if you could fix it kuro games. I play on a s23 fe with max settings and 40fps however it seems to occasionally crash on my phone for some reason, like i can't play it without a crash for like more than an hour."
game so beautiful. I really love this game
"I love this game and I have played it from the very first day of release. And yet till this day I have never won a single 50/50. 2nd is I have completed all other tactical holograms and other tough challenges but the Tempest Memphis one is definitely buggy. The moment you think you're winning and get his hp below 50%, your dodge and counter will stop working. I can hear the sound of the counter and the dodge slow-mo but still you'll take damage and die somehow."
"game started good and now they're trying to censor everything. I purchased a character and 2 days later it her designed changed, I feel scammed and I'd like a refound, I genuinely do. call me whatever but the reason I bought the character was the design alone and it defeats the purpose if they change it 2 days later."
Always Great but the Google censorship is a downside.
"if Cartethyia playable , ill give 5 star"
luck game
The best
Why Kuro? Why did you nerf Cantarella... üò≠ Does anyone else notice Cantarella body design got nerfed...
Undo censorship pls
"Best game ever, despite the harsh start of the game, I remain loyal and patient to the update. love this game with all I have."
"BEST GAME EVER, KURO COOK 24/7! from all the gacha game that i play since 2015, this game really deserve the title of the best gacha game, knowing kuro since Twin tails battleground and then PGR, i think Wuthering waves will be one of the most succesfull gacha game."

releases characters then censors them after. Good ole bait and switch.
"Gotta be honest, The game is awesome, great action with stunning visuals. The battle mechanics are different for each character and so much so that each character can be built and be used. The character designs are just too good, and finally a game where the Main character both looks great and is actually awesome in-game, like Rover is just so great that I think everyone can say he/she is one of the best DPS in the game. Also Kuro is too generous and listens to us, love you Kuro goodluck. Try it"
"The graphics are really great, but the rendering distance is bad, at least on mobile, and sometimes wall of building or floor doesn't load properly, and shadow of characters, in cut scenes, becomes pixelated. Other than that it's a fantastic open world game, great character designs, and I love that the main character has more dialogues, unlike someone else. (traveller) ü§´"
"Its been a year after dropping Hoyoverses most popular games and my selection had been dry since. However, I can very happily say that playing this game was the best choice I've made. It offers you an enticing storyline, unique combat, and wide exploration while even giving optional quality life experience. Playing this game has a better feel to it than most other 3D Adventure RPG's I played, it's different and in a good way! With this game I feel like viewers and myself are heard. Thanks Kuro."
"Snapdragon 870 med setting 60fps have no issues except heating problem Overall phenomenal experiences with this game, continue the optimization kuro love this game and the mechanics"
"[Updated review] Honestly, this game is really good they're generous for free rewards, too. but as time process, the game device requirements become so heavy and the problem they're facing rn (which they did at their previous game) the unfair ratio of male character and female... tbh I could just ignore it. but it's a reason why the majority of people are quitting this game... :<"
this game is so beautiful story and battle plays and skills
Sheesshhhhh
I'm only giving four stars because it's a bit laggy when trying to actually play but from what I can tell it seems to be a really great game with very good graphics on it remind if you genshin impact steroids this would be the game
peak
"Great game!! Amazing graphics, combat style, cute /gorgeous waifuus... Absolute cinema story."
ALWAYS LOSE IN 50 50
"I have been supporting the game since launch and it's almost 1 year but the current Fleurdelys censorship then radio silence about it makes me rate this game 1*. The game is good but i will not be tolerant and support censorship, I will change the rating once they give us a separate version from CN or do something about censorship"
turn it to 16+ then do what you want to do Just care salaryman more than kids
I love the game but my issue is I'm playing it on mobile it's not optimised for mobile even in the lowest setting the games is lagging I hope in the future updates is you'd optimise the game for mobile users because it was barely playable in mobile and I love the game.ü•π
Sistem update versi game terlalu besar. sehingga membuat lama untuk update pada ponsel pintar dan memberatkan ponsel sendiri. saya berharap kedepannya bisa diperkecil untuk update setiap versinya atau ada pra-update untuk game sebelun dirilis versi baru pada in game.
best game ever
Amazing devs who listen to the community!
this game is really good because they actually paid attention to their players instead of just making money the story is well made and rich in story telling it also rewards players really well overall this game better than genshin and hsr
I'm not spending any more money until the censorship is reversed.
Absolute cinema
GOAT just like PGR but i want the story to be more darker(like cbt1)
"bring back the original design of cantarella,you guys disappointed all the player with chaged it without announced,its like we buy a car then the shop owner come to your house and change the tire without the car owner permission. what the heck!"
well so far it's good I like how they adapt from having a lot of bugs during the released to now
please optimise this game more for mobile it becomes very laggy
Game is freetoplay friendly. Gives lota of rewards and always listen and acts on player feedbacks
noice
best game ever with awesome developer
"The 17 GB download processor thing is very bad. If it was 5 GB, it would be much better. If not, it should be at least 7 GB. That's why the 17 GB download is very bad."
"2nd best gacha on the market next to pgr. game is pretty balanced and story is actually engaging, not a total yapfest like other games. i've lost every 50/50 since launch and I'm only missing 4 characters plus I have an arsenal of 5* weapons. other greedy devs should take note! keep the great updates coming kuro."
"best game ever i've played and i like the female character design, people said gathering wives üòõ"
Keep up the great work kuro. Hope you don't turn into hoyo one day.
"Wuthering Waves is an overall very solid gacha game, and is one of the best ones in the gacha genre. it outperforms in almost all aspects compared to pretty much most other gachas that are popular. At the end of the day though the game is still a gacha, and if you're f2p you will still struggle to get your favourite characters through the banners. The game however is still more f2p then many other gachas."
"if you're giving this game a 16+ rating, might as well remove the censorship on upskirt angle. please do your magic kurogames."
good game with very nice control and graphics
"great game, combat, story, and graphics"
whimpering waste is now on my top 1 list of one of the most p2w and horribly balanced endgame so far.. everything i've worked built and worked on characters now feels meaningless unless i get their signature weapons now.. cant even clear basic C rank with standard 5 star weapons and decent echo set builds.. fix this asap
"This is a best game I play before and I finish this game best story and graphics in mobile , and you have to play this game."
"Kuro, you're increased the rating for 16+ yet you ""silently"" changed a mere underwear to short pants, and also another revealing features. Shame on you Lots of 16+ games are having more revealing characters than WuWa. Just don't listen to those nonsense babbling and ranting comes from kids. It's for 16+, those player deserve more"
"This is by far the most ambitious game ever and you guys kept cooking since then. tho, I have a few suggestions and questions 1. Geshu-lin, when? Players have been waiting for this character since launch. He didn't die, but disappeared according to the lore. 2. Flight access to all openworld areas, is this possible? 3. What about an underwater exploration, Ocean Ship Expedition, Fighting pirates and echoes. (Preferrence, Onepiece and Assassin's Creed Black Flag. 4. Capitano but Wuwa version"
"Needs optimisation, for some reasons I can't play in India and have to use vpn"
"the graphics are insanely good, the story is okay, theres a bit too much female characters compared to male characters and most of the female are inlove/interested in mc"
"Better than genshin. As a straight male, I really enjoys playing wuwa with pretty girls surrounding me. edit : after update with censorshipon models, this game sucks and scams people's money"
1 star for the censorship. Cantarella and fleurdelys were censored from their original release.
ÿßÿ≠ŸÑÿß ŸàÿßŸÅÿ∏ŸÑ ŸÑÿπÿ®Ÿá
"Played since the beginning but quit the game. Every character just simp the MC then next one, next one, next one. Soulless plot."
ABSOLUTE CINEMA!!! HAIL SOLON!!!
"bait and switch game, be careful when you gacha in a character because they will change the design later"
"i really disappointed about censorship to character that i adore for her desain, I'm already spent a lot for this character and now you just censored them?"
nice üëçüôÇ
my account got deleted. Give me back my acct
sooo goodo
"Omg best action on gacha ever, i play comfortably on mobile as well, though much better optimized for pc. The storytelling is super top notch as well. Events are fun as well like the fishing one"
"Ok , another review , why was fallacy of return made easy and slowr in the 2.x version, it was better before when it was faster(imo)"
"This is one of the best games I've ever played. The story, the events and everything else is great imo and very rewarding as well. The only complaint I have is that the echo system relies too much on rng. Like I have so many echos that have the wrong main stat. (e.g electro dmg on sierra gale set or def on the 4 cost), and the substats always roll to def and hp for the echoes for my dps and all the crit rolls go to my SK and Verina echoes. Like, what?? Please improve on this."
TERRIBLE game optimization. It is barely playable on mobile devices which is a shame as the character design and playstyle is so good.
"5 out of 5 stars no drama, Kuro games best Devüó£Ô∏èüî•PGR X WUWA whenüî•üî•üî•üò≠why censorship nowüò≠üò≠üò≠"
"Best gacha game for me. The devs listen to player feedback and are committed to making their games better each version. The MC is strong and important to the story. The mascot is adorable and doesn't talk too much unlike the ""other"" game."
"For gameplay is great, but need high ram, and very good connection to play or your server like a trash, its impossible to play every time i start the game cause of lagging or cant start the game from the main menu, other game like yours PGR work fine, Yu-Gi-Oh work fine, only this game like trash it's connection server."
nice
Fraud Game. Cantarella already had sacrifices on her own but kuro did her dirty.
the best
Absolutely stellar gacha open world game imo. This is the most rewarding gacha game experience I have had so far. The combat system is challenging and fun with mechanics and world especially since v2.0 has been phenomenal. And the real plus point of the game is that it's very f2p friendly and the devs take the feedback and improve the game constantly. You also won't be forced to get every new character or weapon that gets released. Long may the quality continue. Good job Kuro Games.
A phenomenon that continues to improve and grow with every patch. The devs listen. The Devs incorporate the feedback. The game simply continues to surprise me.
WHERE ARE THE MALE CHARACTERS?????????????? WE NEED MORE MALE PLAYABLE CHARACTERS
Best gacha game of all time I LOVE CARTETHYIA
amazing
ptm loko si iban a cambiar el dise√±o mejor no hac√≠an nada.
terrible performance...oh and alter characters appearances after their releases...scum company
Awesome game
I'm in love
Downloaded this because of Cantarella Banner but the fact is i got stick to this game so much because of the plot and characters. waiting for the next upd
Censorship is trash
"Technically I would do a 4.5, but I viewed the ""problems"" as nitpicks and satisfied with the results as a whole. My phone is on a mid range scale of capabilities and able to run fairly smoothly with all options on higgest (I guess I'm on a high end? Though it could only handle 30 fps) the graphics have improved especially with the color scale. My only gripe here is that, new players might be overwhelmed. But people can get use to it after a while, its a big leap if you're not use to games."
"2.2 was ABSOLUTE CINEMA, free triple A game here"
Why change to 16+ just to censor it? SMH
NUDITY!
Thank you so much
awesome visuals AND THEY'RE GENEROUS GENUINELY PLAY THIS GAME IT'S WORTH IT STORY WISE AND EVERYTHING
peak game
thank you devs for responding and being considerate towards we players...never have seen this much hospitality‚ô•Ô∏è
"The stories in this game never fail to make me cry or tear up, I am a little sick of the dating sim appearances in said stories but its not the entire story, just little bits of fan service here and there but mostly stuff I can overlook because I like this game so much."
Lowered age rating and enforced higher censhorship for no good reason. Why should a gacha game be catered to children? Predatory move by Kuro Games.
"Love this game, my first gacha game ever. I just want the developers to hear mobile gamers about optimizing and let us still feel the beauty of the game even in low end."
can u make the graphics a little bit better in mobile i really like the game but the graphics in mobile is not that ahm good i cant see the character that much or the environment not that good even if I'm playing at the highest graphic in mobile.
PLEASE DO NOT CENSOR YOUR GAME
best game
An absolute cinema of a game.

game censored characters after charging for them. end of an era.
I am against to the censorship
"This was a heartbreaking review but unfortunately after i left my account for give and take 5 months because I was running out of storage, I cannot log in to it anymore it was most likely deleted by default, that account has been created Day 1 Release, it's impossible that it was a different account since I listed the email and password I used. So for everyone planning to play the game, I recommend you to don't delete the game itself if you quit and still planning to play the game again"
"never thought that a gacha game would be this good, splendid work kuro games I hope you guys continue to add more soundtracks (I'm a sound track lover)"
"kuro please add more male :( , AND GOD CALM DOWN WITH THE SEXY WOMANS, IT'S NOT EVEN FUNNY ANYMORE???"
3 cantarellas in 1 multi
stop the censorship!!!
"Love this game, but censorship of any level is not acceptable in a western market."
very good game. The balance between new and old characters are quite maintained making old characters still pretty good in the newer patch. Gameplay is very fun and The devs are very generous.
"Kuro started censoring characters/bosses designs after their release. Here, have a star."
peak experience
Devs have started to censor designs AFTER release. unacceptable and I will not be spending a cent on this game unless they revert these changes. incredibly disappointing.
this game speak it self the kouro cares bout people and listened this game is Soo powerfull and high quality I recommended 10/10
game is starting to get censored despite raising the age rating. idc how good the recent update have been. im tired of the lies and mistreatment
its a dark and unique world
Take my time
"I love the game, but I'm sick of it getting censored because your overlords are so prudish. Thought you guys were different."
I love this game
extremely good
"came for the wuthering waves, stayed for gathering wives."
Game deployed a stealth patch that censored the character Cantarella and also the weekly boss Fleurdelys. Stay away from this game if you don't like censorship on global servers.
ok ok game
I spent money to get a character and now she gets censored. Won't be spending any money on this game with censorship being a possibility.
best gatcha on the market currently
story of this game was very good and exillent game which I ever play
bring back the old Cantarella design and the old Flerudelys design. No body asked for censorship
They censored Cantarella and Fleurdelys.
"Game got censored. No announcement, no warning, no communication"
goated
I love how expressive the character models are during the storyline and quests...
rip cantarella
"Game need to be improved on mobile version, by the way I don't trust gacha game.."
I love the game absolutely wonderful but its still new and has more to offer this will increase or decrease based on what will happen but so far I love it and the exploration is amazing and easy the combat is top tier I love the music and the boss plus the battle music is amazing edit: my expectations of the game was met and then some kurogames pls keep this up I love your work here thank you for giving us a game that is amazing and equal it just takes skill to clear the end game
i this game and story but its laggy and can play mobile data need reduce the graphics frame rate..
The best Gacha game out there. I've played every Hoyo game and NONE OF THEM can compare to the 2.0+ storyline. the characters and world are so beautiful! and Kuro Games is VERY GENEROUS with rewards!!
Good experience
update they don't gooners like hoyoverse
This game is pretty good
"Have played since May 2024. Best open world action RPG to me. Free to play friendly, almost no power crept in all challenge mode"
"Wuthering Waves improves at every version it releases, tons of changes and QoL updates, which seem rather small but useful for others, accessibilities and so on, Even then the story and especially the cutscenes and character interactions are immersive. Combat wise and the improvement of weaponry is insane, It's more smooth than its initial release and glad that the developers are listening to their players' feedback, although it may be laggy at times it's because it's really graphic."
Peak
the color adjustments in game is amazing update 5 stars for the game
I have more than a 100k raw meat sitting in my inventory peak gameplay
"2.2 peak story, really generous devs, game is a LOT more stable than it is in 1.0, the game devs actually care for you, definitely worth the time to play, little bit heavy for a phone tho but still playable"
It's a very good game and I'm addicted please provide more maps to play and also add characters
bait and switch
good game fellas

greatest gacha game ever made

"Very good game had it for a long time, and it's the best game I've ever had character design is good, gameplay is good, fighting is good, also this game is the best Gacha game I played"
awesome game
Peak Game!
This game is cool
"wuthering waves is my new favorite gatcha game, balanced and devs listens , keep it up kuro"
good game! keep up the consistent quality of the game.
"movement is not fluid alike genshin impact when movements are all fluid. It is clanky. secondly, character are not able to do running. however only good thing is its combat."
"it's overall good and also generous about the reward keep it up kuro, really appreciate the game!"
Very good open world game with console level graphics

AAA gacha game
"Now I'm only giving it 1 star because the lag on my phone is so bad that I can't even play the game properly, especially when I'm fighting the lag! EvenI'm on low graphics, the lag is there! I hope the game is more optimized for law in device so that we can enjoy it on low devices. because the game is good but the lag is no longer funny so I'm going to stop playing for now."
game pembaik
very good game
Rinasita region peak story..
"so far i enjoyed playing this game, the story got better, and the gameplay too. but one thing that maybe i want to add or change, maybe you can add bahasa Indonesia so i can understand more about the story because english version this game use was very formal and hard so sometimes i need to google it. if you nit wanna add at least you can change or hire a better person to translate it, maybe like Don Lee"
"please, add segs feature mwehe"
perfect
"As far I can say, I am enjoying the story"
suka banget sama game ini
just need some optimization for better experience on mobile phone
"Peak animation, gameplay, characters, it's like watching an anime when doing quests, 10/10 would recommend"
just the same as kikir impect. 1 is so selfish and kikir. other just mf god off losing rate of with high pity. play from release date mostly all i got is red pity and lost 50/50.
its works now and its very good game for people who like genshin but want more action focused gameplay and story
"I love this game but I have to uninstall it, takes too much space. I love the graphics and character design tho"
The graphics are great and the story is mostly interesting with some great character designs (the camel toe on the latest character when her outfit gets wet is vile and I wish I could unsee it). The problem lies with the game dissolving into yet another hideously dull harem fantasy. With formerly well written and newer badly written female characters falling at the male version of the main characters feet. Incredibly disappointing.
FUN and Story is so hype
best game ever and with the update on every patch that makes QOL even better is just astonishing
"i really love the game, kuro games is not stingy when it comes to giving rewards unlike other gacha games, for me being generous to your own players makes a big impact through the players gameplay."
"Edit: Holy man, this game is honestly amazing from the graphics, gameplay, how fast they respond to critics and how generous they are this game deserve much more recognition for how much work they put into this game Edit: ... this game is peak, nothing less than that. i highly, HIGHLY recommend this game to everyone"

"I only play on cloud, Thank you devs for such fun and wonderful game, Since you guys made it 16+ rating, Add some extreme action and blood and toggle to turn it off and on at settings, also make a cloud app either for 15 mins free time + ads to extend or pay, Thank you very much"
it's so good
"Best game, good gameplay and music."
"More importantly, the Zani consplay though!"
"good game, Nice developers"
Potato phone here. I'll be playing again after losing to Carlotta last time. I was being forced to be a Calcharo user. RC5 by the way.
pls add motion blur in mobile version and the anti aliasing please improve it
"love this game. love the story writing. love the combat gameplay. love the storytelling. Kuro Games, keep being a great team that listens to the players' voices."

it's so good

Perfect game ever i play on my phone üì±
one of the best game I have ever played
"I'm not gonna sour coat or sugar coat anything, This has by far been one of the best games I've played I absolutely LOVE the scenery and I absolutely LOVE the character design I enjoy the story the combat is super fun"
"This game deserves 5 stars but I gave it 4 stars because I still see some issues regarding the graphics that needs improvement. The blobfly despite turning the resolution in highest and all graphics to highest i still can't see them. I think the problem is how the game renders, only the shadows of blobfly can be seen. Then in main quest story, I encountered the same in the latest story it's bug on the cut scene it's like I'm in roblox the characters are clear but the background isn't."
"Played this once, it felt boring."
Fix the camera zoom it keeps going bazonkas over my fight against tethys
wuwa the best the dev love their community
"graphics have been set to ultra, but the character display is still blurry. do you want the user's eyes to hurt? no matter how good the game world is if the character display is not pleasing to the eye then it's a trash game."
Well the animation and how the character expression and emotion they show how the storyline unfold one by one is pretty amazing
sip gan
"i cant open this game on my poco x7 pro when im using my mobile data, when i tested it the upd connectivity is not pass or it shows an X mark, while i didnt even encounter a problem when im playing genshin, mlbb, hok, diablo. but when my phone is connected to a wifi it will open. i dont know why it will not open when im using my mobile data even though my internet is good."
"""Wuthering Waves"" is a breathtaking game that delivers an immersive adventure. Its stunning visuals, dynamic weather effects, and smooth gameplay mechanics create a captivating experience. The compelling story, emotional moments, and rich sound design enhance immersion. With replayability, hidden challenges, and possible multiplayer features, it offers lasting enjoyment. If you love adventure games wuthering waves is a must-play game.."

180 spin and didn't give the feature character suck game
Best Game!
"From Patch 1.0 to 2.2, WuWa has come a long way. It was buggy at first run but now I can traverse with no problems. Also, they have improved with the storytelling, and they did not fall flat this time! I also like that they have reruns for banners that I wasn't able to get certain characters for, so it was worth supporting the devs for this. I just hope they can release more male characters though, they're lacking in ratio. Keep up the good work devs üëç"
BEST GAME EVER! literally can play this game 24/7üòÇ
gah dam peak bro peak
"The best gacha game, anyone not playing on pc is missing out on amazing graphics and gameplay."
"peak, the best. community good, some ""too many female chars"" complains but idc."
"Currently, this gacha game is thriving, but if it shifts to a 16+ rating, it risks declining in the future. We don‚Äôt need content aimed at kid's audiences. The direction of the game is ultimately your choice as developers, but don‚Äôt blame players if they quit. Many games have died out because they prioritized catering to kids instead of maintaining a sustainable, mature player base."
"its a good game and all but harems needs to settle down, its getting so annoying that everytime women gets introduced they always gets so handsy, so can we please have less of that? making their character all about rover just destroys their character in my opinion..."
this games is very good game's
Overall the game is fantastic üòç The 2.2 updated was amazing the quality becoming more better even though I'm a mobile player the new map is stunning perfect for me to take photo
I reinstalled it again but after pulling garbage character i uninstalled it immediately ! . As expected . Fixed rates. Very easy to uninstall ü•∞
i love kuro
"bro be fr it crashed always. cant even play 20 secondd without it crashed on the area loading. dont let me start on cutscene jpits a guarantee i need to reopen the game and wait 10 min for loading again. can kuro change system or smth idk man be better also kuro be fkn fair to your male-collector players. the heck i need to wait a year for new tall male or another jiyan rerun, while thing like camel rerun every 3 weeks fs. overall exploration is fun. just the story and forced wiafu that is no"

"Really need a past resources management like Honkai Star Rail did where you can delete past mission, cutscenes, and event. The size is getting ridiculous for a mobile game. Segs update when?"
"best arpg gacha game right now, yes its new (so bug for each update surely understandable) but kuro always optimize everything and improving for every patch. not to mention their generosity. as a light spender (monthly subscription only) , i can get what resonator that i want inc the weapon, keep up the great game KURO"

i love this game ü•∞
"Ok how to start.... I started playing it on Day 1 itself during the launch. That time, due to my potato phoneand the global launch issues, the game didn't go well. But I played the game for like 2 weeks and left. That was the stupidest mistake I have ever done. When I got a new phone and started playing after 1.2, I was baffled by how much the game has improved dramatically. Each version is Peak Cinema, each character is like an impactful character to the MC and most of all, The MC is a true MC."
please fix the random crashes on mobile
"Those who complains about not beating the boss and not winning 50/50 in pulls, bro why are you even here and rates the game for 1 to 2 stars?... Are y'all even reading the description before downloading and playing the game?.. I called it a Skill Issue.. If you're a casual player, this game is not for you."
"Very casually fun, thanks Solon and Kuro Games team!"

"Devs listen to their community. You can tell from the beginning to the current update. All changes are customer requests with the creativity of the Developers. Highly recommend. You don't need to spend, but if you do, money well spent."
The characters and story are top tier in this game. 10/10 would recommend.
"Love this game. They really listening to the community and the game has a lot improvements, if you game is lagging, crashing and heating on the phone, just go to settings and low the performance."
One of the best game I ever played been a while since I ever skipped any story in a game before the last game was honkai impact 3 part 1. The story is amazing at least when on Rinascita they improve so much the characters is really good too make you want to get them all the guaranteed weapon gacha is heavenly too make you want to top up and help the game. Please add auto Tune on echo when you upgrade it a nice QOL to have.
it's a great game but the game now has a lot of bugs in low end device's hope it will fix's soon
"I love the depth of the story and characters, I can't wait to see the newest patches for the game.üòä"

i hope you make a turn based combat game too lets destroy hoyo muhahaha
"I was really excited for Wuthering Waves, and I have to admit‚Äîthe graphics are absolutely stunning. The world looks great, the characters are well-designed, and visually it‚Äôs one of the best gacha games I‚Äôve seen. But what‚Äôs the point of all that if the gacha system feels this awful? I lost my first pity and the character i wanted on my very first 80 pulls. That completely killed my motivation to keep playing. A beautiful game means nothing if the core experience feels this unfair."
best developers
Issues prevail since launch. Awful story. Good combat. Copied the good and the bad from genshin. Echo farming is a pain tower of adversity is one of the most unfun experiences ever.
very good game üëç
the best game olnly the best
"With my symptoms, symptoms of sorrow and dread They all said it would fade but again and again I love, I love I love, I love, I love I love, I love, I love wuwa ü´∂"
Need more men characters in the game. Then I'll have no complaints whatsoever.

I have a small issue when I played this game it was great I was still a starter when I had to defeat a boss I cannot damage him until his hp is in the middle they aren't allowing me to damage him I tried several ways idk wether it's about my phone or the game itself I tried restarting and etc nothing still the same so I wish this issue can be solved as soon as possible nonetheless the game is amazing and I truly love it! EDIT: after some of help and figuring out It worked perfectly fine in pc!
I really like it

Best gacha ever
"I so love this game. The game, the devs, the company, the team, the community.. just perfect!"
One of the best mobile open world games I've played. You can play the game without spending a lot of money or not spend on it at all in the game. Devs really appreciate you and give quality content. Not a perfect game but enough to make me happy. Some content can be meh or a hassle like the Whimpering Waste but it there in case you want to play it. WhiWa could still improve as an endgame mode and give player satisfaction.
Best gacha anime game so far. Hope Dev always improve the quality. Dont let players down like certain games.
I recently had to uninstall wuwa due to storage issues but this still remains one of the best rpg games out there
The game is Brilliant nice cinematic story and gameplay the graphics was insane love it
i love all the characters design and their skills is so fun to play
KURO COOK!!!
i really wanted to log back in after atleast a year or more because i missed this game a lot but then after i used my email ofc i use my email for every log in i tried every sing one of my emails and its just so annoying bc i got jinhsi the main reason i quit was because i didnt get her weapon but mehh whatever i just really dont like this
very good journey
greats game
"Been playing Wuthering waves since day 1 and i can say that this game never fails to amaze me with how much they care about their players and release content that actually matters. They won't make you feel dumb and will make you feel that your time is actually valuable. We're on a bright future ahead, and we hope that the game will just keep on getting better. here's to more years with you Kuro games‚ú®"
"The whole story, characters and vast wide open world is amazing. no problem there. except the frame rate is worse. it has low optimization, it kepts lagging below 15 to 24 fps. fix this before I rate this to 5..."
sensational
"still needs more optimization. I still get fps drops and stutters even on a gaming phone, hope this gets fixed ASAP"
"tbh, I don't like the new characters that much- it's leaning into FANSERVICE once again. cantarella might have a sad backstory, but she's clearly bait."
GOOD GAME
please fix crash problem üòî and I love the game by the way ‚ô•Ô∏è
Stop review bombing especially apps and games that have nothing to do with what you are crying about. SUCH AN IMMATURE BEHAVIOR.
"currently I don't have much to say but good job for the developers for making it F2P friendly, but It still needs optimizing for mobile players, but for pc it's really good I suggest playing it on pc for a better overall experience would recommend üòÅ"
One of the best rpg games
THE BEST GAME EVER
I love that the developers always listen to players
Yayy
My suggestion is that this game should be removed because it drives my friend crazy
Amazing storyline
it takes 17G internet at the first of the game
"a great game to be honest, the graphics,gameplay,story just keeps getting even better and the devs? one of the best ones ever, imagine being given 80 astrites not even knowing that there's an issue, they're absolutely generous and the companion stories are awesome especially encore's, all that I can say is just wow kuro really outdid themselves. however I do find it quite hard on focusing on the enemies especially on mobile when there's a few TD, but I know you guys will fix it soon, I hope."
"I honestly love this game, but it's still not optimized in lower specs cellphones. Would honestly play and recommend this to others thou."
Optimaze needed for low-end
"I used to have a account here but I randomly got logged out and couldn't log in again ü´† Other than that, my new account is thriving and this game is popping off!"
just wow gooner or not the game is unique on its own way just need a good device to play it on
so far the game is perfect it's gorgeous the characters are perfect no bad powercreep the only problem is the 50/50 feels sus like I play all day and grind to get a character only to lose ever since I started playing I've never won once nor got any early at least let me lose early and get the character at hard it's really not fair I have a life too I can't spend my whole time playing and I already play a lot plus whenever I enter for the first time it crashes but when I re-enter it runs normally
super game
good graphics good gameplay
"so far so good, F2P friendly, listen to their fan base and what not. Keep up the good work!"
"So far so good. 3.5 because of the lack of chracters/cast in the main story, lack of 4 stars, bad UI design, levelling characters feels cheap/bad, and lack of male characters just feels monotonous/one dimensional and it sometimes ruins my immersion"
"i love this game, even i cant play anymore because device issue, its still have beautiful element and rewards ofc, better than genshin as for me and as for mihoyo player"
koru your the best!!! so far is good for me play this
"I love the story, graphics and battle mechanics also the cutscenes are always hyped to me to the point that I can say is ""absolute cinemaü§öüôÇü§ö"" (I want more events and need more optimization on mid to low devices because every time I skill the game will eventually low fps and the sound when I evade the attack of enemy it crashes the sound I low my graphics still the same) idk the problem if my phone is a problem or the optimization üò≠üò≠"
when you will add Indonesian languadge?
"I wish I could give wuwa a 4.5 but that's review system for you. Played since launch and the game is FANTASTIC. Devs and teams listen to players, beautiful world, amazing designs, a free five star who is good to use. The story is really good, world is beautiful. But! I wish we had agent stories to get to know the characters more, the ratio between genders needs fixing there's so few men and a lot of the cast obsess over rover too much for my taste. But the mc IS amazing and good in combat!!"
kuroooooo we need Indonesian language pleaseeeee.
"Awesome game, good job üëç"
heya been here since launch i made a review already best game ever soo much caring than genshin with rewards and your wellbeing by reminding you played three hour already
good
Need optimization even though the game wasn't not for mobile. But it better then Complain Impact.
I've been enjoying myself playing this game but I've one concern that is only to make it more optimized for midrange devices thank youuu
best game ever
"The best by far, thank you!"
it's the best game I ever play
the new region in sky has a problem in traveling and is hard to control when gravity is switched in mobile
best game in world
"I really love the app, especially my characters. but there is something really bothering me and it's the ""lag‚Äú, please Kuro I hope that you will fix this ASAP because it's really annoying and bothersome, I tried to uninstall and install it and even updated my phone but it is still lagging. Please kindly fix this because I know that I'm not the only one who is suffering from this problem."
ÈÄôËº©Â≠êÈÉΩÁé©
Love WuWa. Have been playing since day 1 on PC. Right now is a great time to start playing because the 1st anniversary is coming up and Kuro is very generous.
good game
"Gooners game literally, the ratio between female and male characters is buns yet when they do add one he'll feel irrelevant to the story."
"Love it, the developers listen to the complain and fix's it in no time, the art and character is very cool, every event is fun, absolutely cinema"
"Pros: This mobile gacha game offers the best graphic quality for an open world game, a great story, more battle experience, more rewards for drawn characters, guaranteed limited weapons and you can choose standard weapons. Cons: You need a mid-range device for a better gaming experience, which makes sense considering the game uses Unreal Engine 4"
Petition for players to get birthday gifts which are in-game just like Genshin Impact does.
speechless the story telling the graphics the gameplay its all beautiful
loved it since launch
bro it's so good
best game
This game is so fun I hope Wuthering Waves update feel better more realistic and characters is so cool not bad i like it and beautiful Open World games.
best game
the washing system sucks but the game is not bad just try to make the story better
nice
"This old uptate time have good optimization, now it's trash I'm wasted my time and money and data , I'm never install this game again , just su ck your this trash yourself, I'm rather to play genshin atleast it's give more then 35Fps , that not like this trash Optimization game , I'm not hater of wuwa , I'm just get irritate for you never listen users review, game optimization not yet finish , same warzone du mp , this game too joing with that like trash üóëÔ∏è"
"The new story was absolutely amazing, this is by far the best story, music, performance I had ever seen in this kind of game. Please do try and attempt it, it is worth it."
super
so kind
"this game is not working to my device, it crashed when I open it, even I have a more space for that, but it keeps me out of the game, I can't play this game. just because of the ram? this game is high on ram? pls fix this. the loading screen at first is smooth but after that, then it crashed unexpectedly."
"Tried really hard to get into it, rng really sucks for me as I get the same standard character over and over so hurts as a f2p...lost many 50/50s just can't anymore."
"It's really good, the graphics, the game is F2P friendly but, it needs more male characters."
ganda ng games nato kaso diko ma fix ung overload settings nag iinit phone ko kit naka low performance
way better than hoyo
(2.2 Version)overheating then force close can't even play it on Android.
looks amazing but I can't run it on my tablette
the best animation ever!
I love this game
very generous on five stars unlike gendhin
"after fighting for 30 minutes trying to get the app to let me register, i gave up. i am sure its a fine game, but i will never know now, will i?"
good game
This game is really amazing it has good quests and characters.
Good Game
"Everything is amazing, graphics, flexible gameplay, design, the MUSIC, combat, leveling up, the gacha system is generous without spoiling you, it's quite a good game but the plot is kind of confusing and a little bit pushed, rushed, too much information and it's hard to connect to characters."
best one i've ever played
best game ever
its a good game problem is it takes a lot of my storage and sometimes when Playing too much lag and whenever i play for about 6-8 minutes i randomly exit the game i dont do it myself my phone does it. good characters and design i like it
nice work from kuro game! üëç
"fantastic game I have ever played, thanks for the exiled heavy duty to making the game."
best game I'll give it 5stars I mean the cut scenes are incredible way better than genshin impact I played that game for like past 4 years and i never felt like this it seems I'm getting attached with a this game haha
It's all 5 stars play it
"only streamers gets lucky, poor droprates on gacha wasted old uid"
"One of best gacha games I ever played. Also, give me luck please, Kuro."
smooth combat and beautiful places to explore
very good game
"game fun, game good, play game"
amazing
"Still in development, cut them some slack A great game otherwise"
"love this game, the character to the story masterpiece."
5 stars
"this game is exceptional, we love all the updates <3 keep it up!"
peak
game tuhan
well done
"Everything is good and wonderful, but I just started to face some problems with the boat movements in narrow places. I hope that you will fix the fault. As for the rest of the things, they are wonderful in every sense of the word."
Totally unbelievable..!! like always KURO games are worth to play
"I dropped this game at first but now it feels so amazing. Although it needs some optimization and has some lagging problems but it could be only in my device so it's not a big deal otherwise the game is awesome. Awesome story lines, beautiful and emerging graphics and the character design Loved it . The game also gives lots of rewards so you don't have to worry about anything just play and enjoy. Thank you Kuro games for giving us such a wonderful Game and awesome Experience. Thank you ."
this game if fantastic I love playing it I really have no problem with the game the story is fantastic our character that we get gets so many upgrade through the story and this game has such a good animation in story cut senses I love this game so much it very good this game only problem is optimization thats it but if you have a very powerful phone than it's not a problem but you can ignore this because the game is to good to not play hope everyone else also play this game
"Fantastic game. One of the few games where developers actually listen to the wishes of the player and make adjustments accordingly. Incredible attention to detail in all the small aspects and gives players a great visual gaming experience. Smooth transitions between interfaces, well-written stories and characters with vivid personalities and backgrounds are all amazing selling points. Even the interactions between NPCs feel human and relatable. There are minimal downsides to this game."
Great game. The character designs are amazing. The story is pretty good and best of all the world looks fantastic i play this on mobile and i still have a fun time
nice games üòéüòéüòé
overheating on sd 8s gen3
wuwa is my favorite game right now. the grphics are so nice. this game is also so generous. I already have all standard 5 star characters after only playing for a month. and now on 2.2 I already have multiple copies of different 5 stars and even carlota and her signature weapon. this is the first game I felt confident in for pulling a character and their signature weapon. I also love the combat system of the game. this game is overall fun to play and also very free to play/casual player friendly
thank you for treating the mc as the MC
I LOVE YOU
mantap
"the best gacha game ever made ... qol is superb , the gacha is generous like seriously 100% rate for weapon banner?! And ashtrites are easy to farm ... All of the characters is well designed too"
couldn't have asked for more a really dope game with high graphics
can you make the anniversary can be choose between the standard character and the weapon some player probably already got the characters instead the weapon that would be great
5 star for good gameplay and good game mechanics not like other open world gacha games running in a plain lands will cost stamina but this is GOD MODE except parcore in the mountains ü§£ü§£ GOD TIER GAME MECHANICS SAAAAAAIIIIIIIKOOO
The is so unfair it might have a lot of rewards but the performance. The game is always stopping and a lot of glitching. For a mobile player its unfair because they are putting more on the effects more than the players fps making it so lag and glitchy. I hope they fix this.
"Cheaper than Genshin Impact, better hero abilities."
nice improvement for developer actually i'll turn to play again.. keep it!!
excellent. perfection.
Let me correct this for you: Waifu Waves
The game is very good but the only problem is not having good optimisation for mobile devices. My mobile can handle games like genshin impact at maximum quality at 60 frame rates consistently but when I play this game my frame rate drops consistently which ultimately ruin my gaming experience. I want developers to make the game more optimised and I know if genshin can so can you do it.
"Good game. Even when it's release went south, they managed to understand the map and is going towards the right path"
best gacha game
the game is crushing.
"These games are so good, absolutely cinema"
üçµüçµüëç
unplayable game lags so much even can't even go to lowest settings
peak game
so far so good
"Good graphics, good game, devs fix issues fast and always listening to feedback"
"The game is amazing. The only problem is my phone not being able to handle it, too bad."
GREAT I just started and did my first pull and got a fiv3 star
"I genuinely hoped to give this piece of garbage called Wuthering Waves, a fabulous rating of 0 stars.It is basically designed to squeeze out your money. I have been losing 50/50 consecutively for 5th time. I used to be f2p but recently been buying it's lunite subscription(basically it's monthly subscription) since 4 months ago, and since then they have been making me lose my 50/50.I hope new players don't fall victim to this money grubing game or it's company. It's same as Genshin. Hope it helps"
I can't play it properly when my phone became hot it's now hanging my phone have a unisoc CPU chipset even in the low graphics of this game it's such a waste have a 4.6% ratings
"Can you guys add a replay for the cutscenes thank you, overall good game"
fix blur anti aliasing in g99 dan buat lebih optimal lagi üôèüôèüôèüôè
"game looks good, but I got stuck in the first boss second stage boss stopped losing, and he is just standing there. idk why this happened"
gud story
"Just like Genshin Impact, but I like this design characters"
My phone cant handle the lag. Even the storage is 256 gb. But its actually good to play. And the story is good. The game can parry enemies attack. Genshin cant parry enemies attack.
better than genshin
burik bang game nya
It's good. I love the combat and aesthetic of the game. But I had to uninstall due to my potato mobile and currently using cloud gaming to play which is bothersome for some input delays. I'll be back with a better gaming device. Edit: I'm back. Bought a new phone. It's sooo goodddd. Edit2: New update is Peak!!!
love this game
so damn sexy female characters.. this game was not for kids
I don't really know but y'all need to make Cloud version like that other game please. I need it and I would pay
game baik
best game in the world
ABSOLUTE CINEMA FOR THIS GAME ‚úãüèªüòêü§öüèª
Best Gacha game rn. Recommended!üëç
"Wuthering Waves is a new ceiling for mobile games.From rich vibrant world building to console level graphics to skilled combat, this offers it all! The developers listen to their fanbase and QQL changes every patch. One of the better games available on playstore. The only downside to it is that it needs a really good device (probably a SD 7 gen 2 or MD 7200 for a stable gameplay at 30 FPS). Overall it's highly recommende for new players who wants to explore a new world and enjoy a rich story."
"absolutely üòä wonderful graphics üòÄ good storyline the best game i ever played , but you need a better device with gaming turbo and a good wifi or internet connection, internet is very imp, it will lag if you don't have a good internet connection, and if you are downloading this in Samsung galaxy tab a8 , you can download, it needs a minimum storage of 20 GB and it will lag but good to play , if you are patience enough üòä"
"Feels great to have an even better story in 2.2 and it might just get better for future patches, I hope this very skilled devs keep improving and never stop at being such generous in it's player base."
"I absolutely love this game and I play it on a tablet, but lately I bought a keyboard and a mouse and wanted to test if I can play the game like a pc, unfortunately, game isn't interacting with the key commands nor the mouse. The settings only have an option for a 'controller', and I hope that soon enough, there will be one for the 'keyboard and mouse'. overall, a lovely game to play <3"
"I've Been Play About 5 Years And Created Two Accounts. 1. Account (Full Level) 2. Account (New Account) As A Second Account I Play Because Of The Game So Cool And Every Chapter Of Characters, Have A Backstory Line. That Making Me About To Cry. I Like This Game A Lot As: 1. Graphics 2. Filters 3. Animation 4. SFX 5. Characters (Voices/3d) 6. Echoes (Animation/SFX) 7. Big Map 8. View Every Places (Natural Views) Thank You Developer As Wuthering Waves Is The Best Game Ever I Play :)"
just amazing.
"i just play this and i really love the game, the graphics, the story, everything ü´∂"
genshin could never
best gacha game out there
nice game to enjoy
"The best game i had ever played on my device. This patch was a masterpiece, the bgm ,the quality, the scenery was all well design. Plus the dev always listen to their player feedback make it 1000 times better, And dont forget they just only getting started. I will stay 4ever for you Kurogames."
"Great animation and effects, the story is solid and entertaining"
"A very good game the best ones I've played so far but there's one issue that I always come across and that's the performance issue I always lag when there's too many enemies so I sometimes don't enjoy it's combat and my phone also somehow overheats whenever I play the game for too long and that it still overheats when I already changed my graphics to the lowest graphics, overall still a very good game would recommend playing this only with high end devices"
it's fireeeee!!!!
I love wuwa I'm so excited to the anniversary
better than genshin
sekarang udah bagus banget perform nya dari pada awal rilis
absolute cinema
the game is good but it's real lagging on my phone and it kicks me out the game like every 2 minutes
one of the best game in the world
best gatcha open world game
"A great solid gacha game, with fair rates and consistency with the rewards. recommend to anyone starting or is a veteran in gacha games."
nice game but it's nice
"Nice RPG game. I enjoy the exploration so much, keep it up, Rinascita is so good, the scenery and the main quest improve so much, the gameplay looks so cool."
"I love this game so much, it's really fun and the characters are interesting. I'm satisfied with the rewards, gacha, designs, and the map. The cutscenes are dope as heck, I really like it. The graphics are beautiful and cool. I'm also satisfied with the customer service. The developer listens to the problems and fixes them than ignore it. I also like how the characters have these smooth movements, it's satisfying to see. Aside from that, I hope Scar and Geshu Lin will be released soon. Thanks."
"Desain characternya oke , pembahasannya juga bagus dan kompleks untuk disimak. Untuk gameplay sudah bagus untuk opening game dan saya akan menunggu beberapa lama sambil menikmati perkembangan mekanik game ini"
The best game ever wuwa!
"Good game, Recommended for the people who loves Adventure and intense pve."
There's too many female characters and it's becoming suffocating especially the fan service and treating Rover like a love interest I've had enough of this please stop this and add more male characters.The ratio clearly isn't fair and I thought the game was an ACTION-PAST APOCALYPSE GAME NOT GATHERING WIVES.I don't mind female characters I love them and pull for them but it won't hurt u to add more male characters and respect your players wishes like you claim to do.
"I really thought I had potential to grow in this game, but it just had been so laggy and it keeps on crashing my game. Even if I factory reset my phone, the result is still the same. If only this game can be played normally in low end devices.."
poggers
"i rate this game a 2 star, it should have been a 5 if it weren't for my account that is lost üòî. So I decided to play this game again after a few months of it being released, and when i opened my account i was back at the very beginning. I lost everything even my rc2 Jinhsi, my perfectly built echo's, my whole game progress gone."
PLEASE fix the lag on mobile it's so bad. I'm lagging on 24fps
"cinema, keep doing what you doing kuro"
best game and best developer
I luv this game
"I love this game so dearly, gameplay is personally really good, but holy smokes the update sizes. I cannot physically play the game anymore as the update requires more space than my phone has in total. please release me from these shackles I would like to play once more"
awesome
"I love the game so much, because of it's tons of rewards of event, free pull, cool character design, i how this game have flying ability now i can explore the whole map so fast. There is one think I don't like that you need to download the entire resources, like in V2.2 it reset my resources and i need to download it again + the resources need in v2.2, i hope the devs can fix this. If not i hope devs can fix this problem and make as want really need do download in that version."
amazing
It's a good time. Sometimes my quality will get a little low and the characters will look like they're sometimes glitching but other than that it's so good
"Amazing game, beautiful character designs. The environment is breathtaking and unique. Really enjoyable story and the optional skip button you can use for main or side quests.. Animations are unique for each character so they don't look like boring copy and paste bots with slightly different clothes.. Really amazing game.. 15/10, would recommend to anyone who likes open world, nice and unique characters and interesting story."
Devs listen
"This game knows how to make boring MMORPG not boring. Although it would be nice to have a better storyline. Not that it's the focus, cuz I'm here for the combat but seriously, you guys can take it up a notch. Everything else is enjoyable."
pretty good game good characters amazing movement has a skip button too and nice graphics only problem I have is that my game keeps crashing and lagging after while I have it on medium my device is a but I do have A55 so that might explain it
Marvelous game i am in awe after the 2.2 update. keep up the good work kuro game. Bravo
"Whatever you guys did with Rinascita. Keep that up and surpass it. Rinascita is the very first moment in a gacha game where I never thought it's a gacha game but a typical AAA non-gacha JRPG in most aspects from the music to the narrative and the writing. What a humongous step-up from 1.0 and 1.x patches are already good. However, don't be afraid to explore darker and mature narratives. Needs more improvement on the writing as well. it's too cliche and predictable. too much fanservice"
"It's a beautiful game. I ended up putting it on an older phone I no longer use because it really takes up a lot of storage, battery and it heats up the phone but wow it's worth it. I also have it on my PC. I'm really loving the fact you don't have to pay to play and so far no annoying ads. Thank you so much!"
"very good good good good good good good good game, Greatjob Kuro"
"I love this game, but I think it would be really cool if a 'NEW GAME PLUS' feature was implemented so you could replay the game from the beginning at any time with all currently unlocked characters, weapons, items, levels etc. avaliable. I know that I would like to replay the game from the beginning and not lose all my progress."
genshin reskin with slightly different gameplay
best game ever
good
Best RPG ever played. I never felt like this in a while.
"this game is amazing. it's a game first,gacha second. kuro really cares about the game and the players, and it's very obvious. I love that. the characters are great,the gameplay itself is beautiful, and the improvements??PEAK. I genuinely did not think this game could get better and I was so WRONG! 2.2 is amazing. can't wait to see more from wuwa/kuro games"
invincible
"FPS is better now - finally! eh, but still can't rate for five stars? why? Because of: too big and long grind. Like: it's crazy, I have to farm a lot of resources + try to drop a significant weapon for a char which also took months! another weird decision: the price for character outfits. The reason I am donating in Punishing Gray Raven a lot and not thinking about doing it here; because of the price for that outfit. even at first realize with discount - it's insane. Everything else is great."
Really love this gameü´∂ü´∂ü´∂
Kuro Devs love Wuthering Waves so the Players also love their game that's it
I have this game on ps5 been playing it since it came out in January I got 300 hours on it and counting I love this game so much I don't even play call of duty anymore because of it
Carthetya when?
KURO THE GOAT
perfect
"it's a really nice game, it's enjoyable, the characters are fun to play and look stunning, and it's just fun overall. My only problem is that the game kinda struggles to work properly in lower end devices so I really hope that the game gets more optimizations in the near future so that the game works better for the people who have low end devices. Overall its a pretty nice game"
"gooner game, fix yo freezing skirt. the graphics Soo fine tho"
"so much fun, first off they give you tons of in-game currency to get characters. I had 30K at one point. the controls and the game feel familiar and are easy to learn. there are always new events and such going on, there's always something to do."
literally the best Open World Gavha anime ever 100/10
nice nice nice
Absolute cinema ‚úãüèºüòêü§öüèº
"LOVE IT,PLAY THIS INSTEAD OF GENSHIN I FEEL LIKE I ACTUALLY GET THE CHARACTERS IM WISHING FOR ITS SO FUN AND THE GRAPHICS ARE EMACTULATE"
This game isüî•üî•
"So you're just like Hoyoverse and every other gatcha game. have a banner character, and 80 pulls doesn't guarantee the character. i thought y'all would be different, but I was disappointed to see otherwise. well, I'm logging off of this game for good. that really was a game killer for me"
"I love the game, But I want more pulls because I'm a gamble addict. please feed me more pulls pls pls pls pls I beg or I cry üòûüòûüòû"
"It is a good game with beautiful graphics and fast combat,decent story but I hope they optimize the game for low and mid range devices."
"The game overall is very amazing, but I have this one major issue. I made a new account to restart, but when I try to fight the Crownless in the tutorial, it won't take any damage after a few attacks. I have tried to restart the app multiple times, but still no changes."

"too many gooner for changli, make more male char to reduce it"
Love it. Everything about it I love it. Tho I feel like I find it hard to save up for characters
Cantarella on my first pull love it
best gooner game
yah game Chota hai iska naam betar game kabhi dekha hai Na koi man Karta kisko gadi itna bakte Na jindagi bahut
Everything is just well made!!
"Im not even exagerating when i say this is one of the best gacha game of all time , im obssesed this is my favourite gameüíû"
ü´°ü´°ü´°
Best game ever üõêüõêüõêü§åü§åü§åü§åü§å
real action + power fantasy GACHA game. i hope it stays that way
"LOVE EVERYTHING IN WUWA ESPECIALLY THE NEW MAP. Seriously, the story pacing is so good compared from the launch, and that's the proof of all devs dedication and love to the game. Rewards is plentiful and the game modes are so fun. Can be played as casuals and try hard. Doesn't feel the FOMO with character and event despite being a semi casual myself. 10/10"
great storytelling and the characters are a feast for the eyes i love it
"Edit: So it got optimized A LOT, it's playable but still lags while fighting or just walking normally, the ms spikes to 100 to 500-900 ms sometimes so yeah, other than that it's improved"
absolute masterpiece üëè bravo!!! i love you devs!!! thank you for your hard work.
Beautiful beautiful game! Devs are reachable and game play is very fun. you can play with your friends or choose to play alone. you're choice.
"I am a new player in this game. I like the story and character design. I like exploring and rewards. What I don't like is that this game looks kinda gloomy. On top of that, it lags even in low settings. I hit level 26 and found the companion quest. I have no idea who the character is, when rover was talking to her, they were talking about something I never saw. Not even introduction. Everything feels like not orderly. And if they don't fix it, I am quiting."
ridiculous playable gender ratio
peak
a masterpiece
it's a very good game
"it's very good game, great character and plot of the story, but I have a problem my game suddenly crash whenever my internet is weak and the game is automatically back at home page and some times my internet is pretty good but my game is automatically back too, I think it's happened every 15min whenever I play and automatically back to my home page of my phone and thank you for seeing this..‚ô•Ô∏è‚ô•Ô∏è"
I've played this game since it was first released and it never disappoints. I hope they could make a couple characters next time
"the game is fine if you enjoy plain fighting or exploration but for people who value good story, well written characters, interaction between characters and actual development, don't even waste your time downloading much less playing. The devs have made it pretty obvious their target audience is male players who love self inserting and getting pandered to. To put it simply, the story is just harem fest and the female mc is often neglected by the devs"
Wuwa is a good game is just the game is very lagging please make your game last lagging üò≠ü´∏ü´∑
sucks
Great game
Best action rpg
"The game is great, the combat is fun, the story is just good, and the characters are the best. However I will have to rate it at one star for now and quit for now. With the recent 2.2 update the game is unplayable on my device. Frequent crashes in rinasita while exploring, elite battles, especially on bosses and nightmare echoes, in Whimpering Waste and the new event Virtual crisis. I know this might be a me problem, but I don't have the means to buy a new device rn. I will quit fn until then."
Made me speechless
could you please make the loading screen faster? I've been stuck on compiling shaders for a while after I downloaded this again
Love this game. All of the designs are fabulous. The combat is also really fun. And the rewards are a bunch.
"Great game. However ... Running on 300ms all the time is a bit too much! (19/06/2024). ____________________________________________________________________________________ Edit: I have a premium account with almost all characters and weapons (fully stacked). However, my ms remains 300+ and customer service was hyped a year ago when the game was released, now no one answers and no one cares. I stopped playing and I'm putting my account for sale! (06/04/2025)."
"idk just didn't click with me... Like they overload you with buzz words and alien terms right at the start, the unkskippable and emotionless cutscenes are a pain to watch, buttons are dull and small which makes the combat not so, beginner friendly?; The visuals are decent, but overall it doesn't really feel unique... It just doesn't have anything that would make want to play this over genshin. Rather than copying genshin, why not try making something unique like zenless ??"
give me cantarella already plz
ZANI CMON!
Basically just G game but better
W game
Incredible
pls solve the crashing problem of game it was crashing again and again and because of that I can't even make progress in game
"Beautiful world, Beautiful graphics, pretty faces.That's it.The story at the start sucks.Only reason I still stayed was Scar.The story gets better from 1.1 but it's same formula.Waifu meets, waifu needs help, waifu is helped, we have some flirty moments with waifu, waifu thanks. Rinse and repeat. Its still very beautiful though. Also the World building is good. It is a gacha by men for men, so most of cast is female. Players who like to pull for male characters, you will be wasting your time."
"Genuinely the best gacha game in the market. Breaking expectations left and right, releasing banger stories one after another. I love you kuro games, please never become hoyoverse"
very unique game
i CANT play on THIS GAME WITHOUT GETTING KICKED OUT!!! ive already sent a message about this and they havent fixed it from the start everytime im trying to make a wish it kicks me out its been happeing to from the start of the game.
The better gacha game in every aspect!
op 5 star character only 10 pullüî•üëçüóø
"started playing at 2.1 , as a new player that just started the exploration are fun but combat are a miserable and monotonous experience! pulling for 5 star characters isn't helping at all. Hoyoverse's standard banner have many 5 star characters that are fun to play and decently powerful for a beginner. Wuthering Wave's standard banner have only 2 good 5 star characters , while the rest is locked behind limited banner. Starting the game are same miserable experience as Natlan!"
"Amazing visuals and story telling! Loved the combat, can't wait for more!"
peak
bro it amazing I'm speechless I mean it's my first game in my new phone just saw this on tiktok so I decided to download it and give it a try but it's amazing love it
Bad rates on weapons with virtually no way to acquire any decent amount of weapon banner currency.
Gooner game
I love it very much! üíóüòª
Masterpiece Wuthering Wave... I'm really fascinated by the elegant girl characters like goddess... Lovely goddess waifuable ü•∞
Peak (no other words needed)
"best game, best devs. love it!"
One of the best games! respects my time
It's graphics are far better than that of Genshin. love it
"can ran pretty good on my potata ahh device with 64 gb of storage and 4gb of ram there some stutter here and thier but what do you expect my device is trash, tho this game is very device friendly"
"Wuthering Waves is good but I am alarmed at the lack of 4 star characters and male to female ratio. They could easily make a quickswap, aero erosion, spectro frazzle 4* support but won't. If you are going to make hyperspecific teams or niche characters, make sure there is a 4 star alternative. At the moment, you have to pull 5 star characters to complete a team. Aero rover cannot even apply aero erosion. You will need Phoebe. Worst part is, I will probably never get to change this rating."
Trying it but yeah I'll change my mind later
"The game was beautiful I have no complaints about the game. Graphics, story line, character and missions are excellent the only thing is it lags alot and take more time to load the screen which is really a bit annoying and many glitches"
good game!!
PEAK
"Im so glad I decided to try this game. At first, I thought it was just a cheap copy of GI until I played. The graphic, performance n storyline is far more than I expected. The characters designs are also amazing! I personally love the grapple feature. Overall this game is great! I wished i could add more players to the team tho.. 3 characters only is too little for me since there's so many characters that I want in my team.. I'm sure this game will have a bright future. Looking forward to updts!"
"So far this is the only game I truly love. It was fun, the graphics are good too, the experience the developers provides are the best, hopefully this company grows to be large and for this game to continually success, not only they listen, but they also deliver üòä"
"The games performance is terrible. The story is one of the worst I've played in a gacha, and there is so much pointless dialog that I fall asleep before a fight comes if it ever does. It's a shame the launch of the game was rushed so much, and so many things lack polish since I know kuro can make amazing games, but this release has been terrible. edit as of 2.2, they have improved everything. The story is compelling, the characters are interesting, the music is great, and exploration is amazing."
My only nitpick for this game is that it seems like male characters are kinda in a brink of extinction. Why is there 1 man for every 10 female playable characters? Did most of the male characters got hit by a meteor and went extinct???
very f2p
It's a good game if you don't believe me try it for yourself
really fun! I can't wait for more updates
so bad
"Gamer First, Gacha later"
my account got deleted after i log in back
"Great graphics, excellent storyline. Way to complicated for me"
Game needs more obtimization
Nice game specially for free to play games
cheap copy
amooo
no guest play option
The only problem is that it lags.
"Good characters/character building, combat, visuals, and story (except for the beginning, which I thought was alright but apparently people hated it). Responsive devs, pretty f2p friendly, really not much to complain about. Perfect for replacing a similar game that's been consistently declining in quality."
"beautiful game but please remove the premium tuners, I have more than 2k hours in the game and I seriously mean it's really disturbing, If it's removed it's a five star for me"
add a world chat would be good üòÅ
Absolute CINEMA
great game the story is well done the characters are beautiful and stunning the devs actually listen and make the game good
i love it but i really wish you make the experience in mobile gane smoother. the current update keeps on auto-exiting mid combat. i wish this is fixed ASAP.
fun open world game.
"wow, my original review is magically deleted. I was coming to edit it. I wish I could give this game 0 stars. today, for the first time ever, the shaders took 2 hours to compile... during his during the final like 40 minutes, I got bored, and played a game that requires more processing to even play. it loaded up fine. how about respond instead of deleting reviews. I'm beginning I suspect these devs are only concerned with taking our money lol"
The best gacha game i've ever played. I left genshin to play this masterpiece from kuro
"i'll leave the 5 stars review here, but i just have one complaint since 1.0: we need more male resonators. i don't understand why you avoid male characters, i feel disappointed. but i know this is a good game and you really love your own game, so i'll keep that 5 stars (me still disappointed tho)."
why always bug
Cutscenes are absolute cinemaü´Çü´Ç
5/5 storyline
"man.. i love you Dev's! you guys are doing your best & i like it but... please make the playable characters bit more beautiful, especially the 5 stars. look at hsr/genshin/zzz. they have really good looking characters. they balance everything properly. you guys over sexualize the characters which looks really bad. looking at the current banner, canterella has a beautiful face but the cloths... she looks like a prostitute, eww. it doesn't even look sexy. i had to skip her coz of the clothes :("
5/5 (pls let me win 50/50)
i got cantarella
"this game is great ,great story,music and graphics but Kuro plsssss fix this lag ,the game feels Unplayable and demotivates me to play but I love the game so pls fix this quickly"
"Fun and rewarding, but I wish there wasn't such a huge focus on female character releases 80% of the time."
"What wrong did I do you guys, I one time woke up to play Wuwa and found out the game files that I downloaded with the game are no more and with the new update, right now am supposed to download 17GB all over again, why did that happen"
Overall the game is good.But the main issue is optimisation for low end devices my device can run genshin on medium settings 45 fps but this game lags a lot on low settings.
Best game with best dev.!
Game baik
"Everything is almost perfect,just need performance optimization for Android."
"Played again after my account stopped loading at 60% for 4 months and this game has improved a lot! It still has some flaws like horrible mouse smoothing on PC, enemies leaping far from you and then resetting their health cuz they went too far. Edit: i just completed the story of 2.2 and with the changes to storytelling, emotion and sense of attachment to 1 particular character this game is definitely improving by the patch. take your 5 star review and hope this trend keeps!!!"
love the damn game... ex PGR player here
"The overall game experience is good, it's engaging and entertaining ; but I have faced some serious issues needed to fix, first in-game world's saturation is way to dark and unclear, and it's graphics and resolution poorly polished, even echos and other pikable items got camouflage sometimes. Distribute colour properly and make the world brighter.... otherwise i will have no other change than leave this game."
"gausah banyak komen dan saran, intinya lanjutkan!!!"
"Kinda lags a bit when there's a lot of enemies on screen, and it STILL lags even when I'm playing on the lowest graphical setting. Still pretty fun, though. There's a lot I can do and experiment with. edit: Now I can't adjust the graphic settings on my phone so it doesn't overheat. and it's not available on the tablet I have."
idk but the ulterance of marvel has a bug when I reach the monster's half health it stops fighting me and I keep on attacking but the health won't decrease. please fix the bug
"jeez , this game gets more laggier and i have a brand new phone.. the loading screen wont even load"
The best gasha game
worth it game and can I please lower the pull pay even just about 1200
nice game but my luck is bad
"Respected kuro games, I'd like to address 2 problematic glitches that I'm facing during playing the game. I've playing this game since release and I've never seen these glitches happening, as these happens after v2.2 update. 1st: During fighting a boss, enemies or anything, when they hit or i dodge their heavy attacks or normal attack, the in-game sound (including effect sound) suddenly breaks and come in as if it's lagging, but it is not and it becomes normal after sometime. Only after v2.2"
I'm lazy so it's amazing for me and for everyone
"I love this game, the story pacing had it's issues back in 1.0,but the new story is perfection. I can't wait for more."
the one of the best open world game in android
I like this game
"just quited genshin, hsr and zzz because someone hacked my account"
Graphics amazing
"Good everything! The rewards are exceptional, the graphics are magnificent (although I have a potato phone so I cannot experience it), the story is very well written, the combat is absolutely amazing (once again I have a potato phone so having better device will be better), and most importantly the developers in Wuthering Waves actually listen to the reviews(unlike a ""certain game""). Seriously Wuthering Waves is a recommended game for players that are interested in gacha games orgames in general"
"we still love you to this day, Kuro games. Keep up the good work."
Amazing game.
"so far, so good. I just need to upgrade my phone to keep up with the game itself."
The perfect game!!
best game ever
The best gacha in the market right now is that the Devs are very good with the community and are constantly improving the game. 6/5 star ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ‚òÜ
the graphic and design is spicy
it keeps crashing in this update
"great kuro, please be more great"
"Wuwa has demonstrated what Open World Anime based style RPG needed in gamers community. Not only a vast exploration and solo/party component, it also brings new QoL and changes that usually NOT added in any different same game style becoming the best seller game even less than a year since this review posted. Also they brought massive rewards to all of us whos consistently play each patch and much more to you newers. Totally recommend!!! üëç"
i loved the game but there's need more optimization for mobile/phone player
"this game is absolutely beautiful, but there's a problem with it. wherever I try to play on my android tablet, I lag, and I can not put the quality higher than the standard one since it lags a lot, even if it's really low. whenever I try to go further into the story, I always crash. that's why I usually need to play on my iPhone, so I don't lag or crash. I would be even happier if there was a way to fix this. thank you."
"no new male character, sad"
I love combat characters cutscenes choreography story was mid until 2.0 but it's awesome now
best games
good
terrible optimization on mobile..... This was supposed to be a mobile game..... But it was built for something else... Apart from that amazing game.
good
Mid story
thabk u
"I've tried everything to make it less laggy for me and it's still not working, I've just played WUWA again after a few months of quitting, please fix this problem as most mobile users problems are the lag."
"Can you even call it the same game, with the amount of Changes from 1.x to 2.x. Surprised that Devs actually keep up with how players play the game and what they want. Never seen a publisher open for feedback to that extent and feels like any change is on the table."
"Just an incredible game, the scenery and combat is beautiful, and the game actually feels like a challenge with the Holograms, as well as the new tower of adversities. The characters are all spectacular both lore and design-wise."
"yahhh,generous than genshin"
Hoyo could never. I could already tell even without playing Wuwa due to lack of better specs and because im sure the anniversary rewards would be better than what hoyo gives
GENSHIN COULD NEVER
good game
worse experience
mooore!! this is so much fun
"Great game. However, I started playing on my mobile. Couldn't play it because of my storage so I haven't played for a while. Last week i got a computer and i wanted to start playing again but when i tried login in my already existing account it was telling me after i logged in that my account is completely new and the old one doesn't exist. I don't want to lose my account and I don't know what to do :/"
peeeeeaaaak
good
"Wuthering Waves is a fantastic game with stunning graphics, smooth gameplay, and a captivating story. Every character feels alive, and the combat system is fun and fluid. I really enjoy exploring the world and learning about each character‚Äôs backstory. The game runs well and doesn't frustrate players. I would love to see a Burmese language option added in the future‚Äîit would make it even better for players from Myanmar. I'm always excited for new updates and will continue to support this game."
"Excellent, for both game, and devs"
still having some lag issues on the game why is not a mobile phone game friendly ?!
9/30 gender ratio is insane. just market this as a dating sim.
‚ù§Ô∏è
To strong enemy
"the game lags on my phone multiple glitches, pleaseee kuro optimize the game for low end e devices i really really want play ittttt"
Your ace wing quest sucks!!
Peak gameplay
superb
Very slay. Needs more men tho so 4 stars for now.
I love the fighting style And it's so good to play omg I recommend to download!! Though it has some laggy issues
too much fanservice and barely and male characters
too much fanservice and barely any male characters
game terbagus yang ada kat mobile ni tak macam roblox
17gb download after initial?? ridiculous
"ABSOLUTE CINEMA ‚úãüòêü§öBut... I do have some feedback regarding of this game's graphics on mobile. To be honest, the rendering kinda sucks lol. Objects become textureless and plain once you get JUST slightly far away from them. Also the effects in this game are a bit... unpolished? Some enemies burst out flames and it'd look like a blurry pixelated PNG with rough animation."
"this game is very awesome, i like the features the mechanic and the stories overall i like it, but when it comes to performance it's not good when it comes to performance genshin is better, but overall it's good tho hust not recommended for low end devices."
I would of kept the game if I didn't lose my 50/50 on my FIRST BANNER at 75 pulls like come on who's going to want to keep playing after that
great
solid gameplay fun and interesting story and there's lots of opportunities to earn pulls even after you finish the story üëç
the combat is good and the story is nice
Best rpg in terms of character designs and combat styles and also the xxxx plots
gatcha ga pelitt dapet gratisannn good game
best gacha game I've every played
good I like game girls
"I thought I was going to download 7GB of additional mandatory files after downloading from play store but when I open the game for the first time 17GB was waiting for me. There weren't any button or menu in the initial UI which you can select file size, or maybe I couldn't see, but 17GB right of the bat is crazy huge in my opinion. PS: I had to delete the game without even playing it."
This game is actually pretty cool the graphics are crazy strong i will definitely play this game every single day
"I don't think there needs to be an explanation on how good these devs are. Ever since coming to this game from HSR and Genshin, it has been a life changer for me. This game is like no other for me. I remember seeing an ad on tik tok to preregister for the game and i thought why not since it looked a lot like genshin. Turns out I'm still playing it from day 1. This gacha game is amazing and I wouldn't do anything to replace this game or the devs that actually care and listen to the WUWA community"
"Every patch this game strays further away from being a mobile game it really is becoming more catered to pc and high end phones cuz if you don't have those you'll have to bear huge fps drops like ur diagnosed with schizo and with the graphics and experience like it's an unpolished game with polygon ah graphics, oh what's that I didn't know I was playing the love child of Minecraft 2 and DMC but I'm always high and schizophrenic like my grandpa on a saturday night"
its fun
good
I always have fun when I play that's all that matters to me
the best out there. Genshin impact but better.
I like playing this game but I have a hard time understanding the language in this game.I hope you add subtitles in Malaysian or Indonesian.
"Gameplay is is good, graphic was pretty, but thats it, every single patch is just girls gooning over MC, the story is barely surface level with no substance this game almost feels like a Galge/Dating Sim with how much the devs romanced MC with Female Chars, the characters barely interact with each other, it felt like they have no life outside the MC so the world felt very empty"
Devs actually listen
One of the best gatcha games rocky release but now almost at 1st anniversary devs have showed they care very f2p friendly and its kinda like a anime souls game
even good
super good can you just optimize the graphics for low ed phones
"The recent update has significantly affected the game's performance. I'm experiencing frequent frame drops and lag, which were not present before. Please fix this issue as it has made the gameplay much less enjoyable"
Best
absolute cinema
"this game is amazing and it reminds me of genshin impact but with better graphics and better mechanics, but please optimize it for low end devices like mine Motorola G54 power 5G..I know my phone may not be the best but if I have the option to download the game, at least I want to play with a good amount of fps , I'm not asking for a perfectly smooth gameplay because it's almost impossible if not impossible but please make a small performance fix..."
need more male characters
amazing
best gacha game ever
"The game story and graphics are beyond expectations, but events are time gated, not allowing you to finish them in 1 day, and if you miss playing days you might not be able to get the rewards you want. Absolutely horrendous unlike the other gacha games where it is possible to rush the event in 1 day when you have no time. Furthermore, you need a decently operating phone in order to play it. I play on a Samsung s24 fe and the game keeps bugging out and crashing. Do not recommend playing this game"
Beautiful. Just beautiful. Also the devs listen unlike some others :)
Best open world game really deserve 5 star.Graphic quality and story line is peak awesome and characters design too.keep it up KURO devs!
iam unable to play it in laptop always some file is missing or error while start up
very nice game try once and you will know
good
"I am out of words. I have never played a game like this in my entire life,the recent update was mind blowing the animations, the story telling are out of this world! Each storyline posses a great meaning of its own. Character quests are fun etc. I had been playing wuwa since launch. the importance that they give to their main character is good. I wish for more exciting updates and let's. hope for the best. üòÑ"
good
"gooner game, but its goodüòéüëå"
this was amazing game but the graphics can be much better
"This game does a great job in every aspects it needs to be, good rewards, good exploration, good story and the graphics is a chef kiss man every time a cutscenes Pop out I can guarantee you that every frame of the cutscene is a thumbnail and the movement system is so fun I could spend hours playing around the movement mechanics and again, the abundance of rewards really makes it nice to play overtime. the only thing that this game lacks is a replay cutscene for the quest you have done."
kinda laggy
biased!!üò§
not outputting slop unlike a certain other open world gacha
I continuously enjoy your game. Thanks you.
it's good
Best. Keep up the good work kuro!!! Update: 2.2 IS SO PEAK!!!!!!
FAVOURITE GAME
good
"For whatever reason, y'all have stopped being friendly to mobile players."
W game
"The combat gameplay in this game is great, and the animation looks amazing too. However, the story and dialogue are hard to follow they feel too complex and confusing. The voice acting (English) is also a letdown. It sounds like it was recorded with a tin can mic, and some characters just sound lifeless, like there's no energy or emotion behind their lines. Another issue is that the game needs a strong internet connection."
My account is gone and all of my characters is all gone and process too üò≠üò≠üò≠ I tried all of my Gmail account but It didn't work at all üò≠üò≠ my characters is all lv 40 and all of the process is just gone. I work hard to get all of the characters but the process is gone. I still love the game tho üòÖ
"Pros- 1 - graphics is on par , a very beautiful world with gorgeous character designs 2 - combat system is just top notch , you get to parry and dodge your enemies also comes with various in and out animations of chars in combat 3 - interactive world , bored of exploring ? Fighting ? indulge in the mini games of this world.Race against time and collect coins by becoming a dragon fly or a pufferfish ! It's super fun! Also you can ride bikes! the evil org of this game needs to be more evil"
my only complaint is the absurd update size consuming a lot of data
"best game ever, from story, design, combat mechanism, graphic, 1000/10, but what disturbing me is the too high of a device requirements, maybe you guys can make a few adjustments, then the game will be absolute PEAK."
very bad
"2.2 is Absolute Cinema can't wait for more great cutscenes despite me skipping all dialogue, also kinda F2P friendly in my opinion since u get the character u wanted to begin with since events are loaded with currencies."
It's pretty good üëç
fun.
"Fourth review, the developers really did listen to the reviews , Rich story telling , stylized art style, smooth gameplay and so on.. but one thing is about the storage..When the updates came , the game erased every data and started to redownload all. It gave us a lot of time to consume.."
Best game
genshin could never but it still needs optimisation
I love it!!
dagko ang kuan...
Looks Good but frame rate drops every second
"Love this game so much! Especially the lore! This is the first game I've ever played where MC is just, well, an MC! Keep it up Kuro! :)"
Best By far didn't expect less from Kuro since I'm og PGR fan too
good üíØ
if you like story games this is for you
i really love this gameü´∂üèº
"my experience on this game is great. iwas suposed to rate this a 5 star. but istarted playing on when it released but just till now, the update really wiped my data on the experience for no reason what so ever. its really sad and like igrinded there and iwas already level 60+ to 70+, its anoyying that my data got wiped too, my characters igot and the weapons. it was so good too. wuwa please do something.."
Great
"cannot explain in words how great this game is, the best game ever, no other gacha game is worthy to be compared with this masterpiece, it is a must try, once you try it I can gurantee you will surely love it, at first the story may seem a bit off but as it proceeds forward it keeps becoming better and better, especially the newly released 2.2 inverted tower main story is too good, it is an absolutely cinema"
great game gg
"The day i started to play this game is the day that i found another gem, love the combat style and the stories, the improvements really is highfive,"
"This game is so unusual from the other gacha games, like how you treat your MC like an anime MC itself. I'm glad that I'm waiting for this game since the first release. But i faced some issues where the game is kinda constantly lagging due to high and far rendering distance. I would like to see and update where we the ""Rovers"" could adjust our Render Distance as we like, to avoid crashes and fc in the game."
2.2 was absolute CINEMA Good job Kuro bravo
hope they make it better
amazing game
very enjoyable and best in storytelling and role-playing aspects in my opinion
This updated 2.0 version is the best anime gaming experience
"I love how lucky I am in my first gameplay, the combat feels awesome! If there's one feature I want to be added it would be walk button, it's a bit hard to walk when using the joystick. I'm enjoying the game."
"Best open world game, period. However it is better to play it on console or pc, on mobile its rather suboptimal."
5 stars. great game I've ever played
"I love the gameplay, the story and the characters"
This is the game no one can beat and because the graphics is awesome character is mind blowing and most important thing is the combat explode your mind try this game and you wouldn't regret üëçüëçüëçüëç
"The best overall game I've ever seen in mobile. A great system for upgrading characters, also a great system of collecting resources. All is free. The gacha mechanism is also better then other games. And also they give you enough currency to buy new characters. Also the best devs you can ever see is here. Devs will always listen to you. But obviously there's some way to give advantage to players who are ready to use money. And it's obvious the gotta earn, you know."
I have been playing this game from the very first day of their release and I love this game. But what do I get? Haven't won a single 50/50 till date and they always take 60-80 pulls every single time. I'm just fed up!
LOVE THIS GAME SO MUCH!!
GENSHIN COULD NEVER
none of the updates download and I barely have any files!!!
sush amazing game i always like sceneries and world better than any combat and this game masterpiece in this ‚ù§Ô∏è and about characters this game really need more males characters i feel many times i play in girls games not everyone loves playing in girl characters all the time .. this really need to fix asap
Love the Game Honestly So Much. I want you Make a app where Wuthering waves community can interact with each other just like hoyo-lab
My opinion 1.[fix lag issues for android](keep crashing out when playing) 2.[I hope either ciaccona or zani be free please] 3.[Make more cool character that has different gameplay than focusing on the type of weapon] 4. Please make more (gusts of welkins-4 bosses monster)] 5. make each region sentinels echo please (i really want the sentinel of rinascita to be usable)[the design caught my heart]. 6. More reward 7. I hope Kurogames will create more male character with awesome gameplay. TQ
w animation worth it for the 17 GB
nice
"best open world game, amazing devs"
"Top tier story, top tier action and top tier animation. Just an issue faced by me do solve it, as I'm not able to experience the best of the graphics of the game. I have 6gb RAM mobile and yet I'm not able to see the best possible the graphics and I also gave unnecessary ping issue upto 300 even if I have a personal high speed wifi. Do suggest me the necessary editing I can do in my settings to experience the best graphics/animation smoothly. Drop the tips for settings improvement here."
"honestly.... I like the game. it's a very good game, I had started this about 2 days ago, and it's been one of the games I've played the most recently. the graphics are solid, the story is actually pretty and good, and the animations are incredibly well animated. I would choose this game over any other Gacha type game."
ok
"Quitting GI for good was the best decision I've done in my gaming life. This game really is far more better,it feels like I'm watching an anime everytime there's a cutscences and the art is just perfect. Even the combat is great and enjoyable,would recommend this game 100%. I look forward to the future of this game and hopefully,they won't turn into some greedy company..."
Âä†Ê≤πÔºÅ
nice game play it
"dev always listened, great story"
so laggy..
Warra game
I love this game and the company so much. They care so much for their player and always trying their best to give us the best gameplay possible to their player. Thank you kuro game we love you ^.^
"Great game it lags a lot, but it's to be expected due to how young it is. It's got great graphics but the game play is really annoying as it forces you to fight a boss in a guide and that boss is clearly made too strong for its level as I go 10 levels above it and it still one-shot my units if it's in a in-game guide it probably should be fair for beginners a lot of enemy's do this where they do way to much damage then some enemy's deal nearly no damage"
the best gacha game ever made
It's a fun game but my phone has issues it's a bit old so I switched to a pc and it was worth it epic games gave me a headache but the game is fun good graphics and gameplay mechanics.
Best Gacha Game ever!!!
great storyline
"I don't have any complaints about the graphics, storyline, gameplay. All of them is breathtaking and excellent. But the most annoying part is when I get the frame drop while my device is in fine condition, not in a heated condition, ping just seems fine in game. I think that one needs to be improved IMO."
awesome game
"If you're looking for a thrilling action RPG with a compelling story, gorgeous visuals, and deep, satisfying combat, look no further. Wuthering Waves is a must-play.‚ù§Ô∏è"
losing 50/50 is not a pleasant experience in this game
Nice game need some improvement
Game is gorgeous... oh i changed my rate... beautiful
This game is the bomb!!
"I liked the game, the story was ok. Characters were forgotten along the way with no story relavence. A clear favoritism for male players with the way they design female characters. At first it was fine, unique designs and not so creepy. Shorekeeper didn't really seem to fit in with her design but just ignored it. Now with the release of Cantarella and their disgusting design choice for her lower body and it shows the direction they're heading. No respect for female characters or players."
epic
idk the game kinda boring and why its lag so much on phone eventhough i use gaming phone lmao
the game a bit choppy
best game!!
zani should be a shielder since she blocked water from the whale and camellya need a zero knockback support.
good game
I LOVE IT SO MUCH!!! I'M SO GLAD I PICKED THIS GAME UP
can you please not release 10 mb patches that not loading game after installing after 2.2 update üòë üôÑ This is 3rd time ok how many times more so I prepare for this
"thank you for listening Kuro! ive been struggling to find best possible damage and some events is using time-based which is my biggest enemy. but newest events battle without time-based is really helping me. time-based events, especially battle, is hard because even tho i have 73% crit rate and 250% crit damage, i still barely reach the highest possible damage. i sometimes lost the event rewards cuz my damage isnt high enough to kill enemies before time running out. keep that for upcoming events"
Going offline for a month then when I return my account is banned? Terrible.
"THE ABSOLUTE BEST GATCHA THERE IS.. The game just feels like playing a proper AAA PC title, the character designs, the story telling, the amount of emotions each character shows in story is just awesome. Also the exploration is extremely good and comfy.. Most importantly the devs always listen to player feed back and spends no time to implement anything qol/ change anything if their playerbase is not satisfied with something. Honestly this is how a game should be, respecting it's players base."
Fantastic game! I would recommand it to my friend.
cant do the event keep on crash
"Finally, I found a gacha game that has an engaging story, beautiful art, super fun combat, and gives us players a lot of free stuff to work with. Oh, and they actually care about what feedback the player base gives them!!"
Boring
"(s24 ultra)it has its ups and downs. it's on mobile so yk, compared to pc and console looks wise its alot worse. For the most frames i have almost everything low/off, ofc turning everything up heats up my device more and lowers fps by a small bit. I don't mind having my graphic settings low tho bc i play this on my phone for things like dailies and such. Mobile render distance is terrible but it makes sense...it's mobile, lol. overall fine."
Peaküî• Please remove the frover. Gathering wives should only have a male MC.
"good visuals and gameplay, this is the example of good gacha game."
Best Characters Design
"This game is not f2p friendly and super pay to win, enemies hit way too hard, need to be good at dodging/dodge counter or get 1 shot, 50/50 for characters, some events are difficult and not fun, gacha currency locked behind hard content"
best of the HoYoverse type gacha games I've played. better than HoYoverse actually
goated.
"This is my second review for the game and we went from 3 to 5. 2.0 just changed everything and for the better visually incredible, unreal character design, and incredible content I'm mainly playing the game on console but for mobile players wanting advice I would EASILY RECOMMEND wuthering waves. Also just so you know anniversary for the next update so get ready for even better stuff in the upcoming updates. The devs always deliver amazing game that loves and respects their community."
Absolut cinema
"Great story, graphic and beautiful music, yet crashes from time to time edited: I love you kuro"
Good botw game. Intuitive fast action combat and travel mechanics. Lacks some elemental interactions with the environment.
Absolute peak
"great game, awful fan base."
"the game is very generous. i already have 4 5* chracters and weapons, and i really appreciate the guaranteed limited weapon since it has saved me from breaking f2p."
it seemed like kuro was addressing the performance issues and it was getting better. but since the release of 2.1 lagging in combat to the point of the game being unplayable and huge cuts in frame rates. I've gone over the wuthering waves subreddit and I'm not the only one having this issue. even p.c players have noticed roughly a 50% decrease in performance and have had to adjust settings down significantly. unfortunately the performance has gotten so bad for me I've had to uninstall.
ABSOLUTELY CINEMA! THE QUALITY OF THE LORE THEY SERVED... IT'S JUST... PERFECTT... MASTERPIECE INDEED!!! WELL DONE KURO GAME... WELL DONE!!!!!
KUROOOO! MAKE MORE MEN AND MY LIFE IS YOURS!!!!
The game is Super but the optimisation for an android is the worst i have dimencity 8100 and it's lag horrible I love this game soooo much but the lag makes me hate this game. Overall this game is too much good i love this game
"I really like this game. It's fun, friendly towards those who don't spend or spend less on video games and the characters look amazing too! I'm a day one player and will keep playing: )"
Umm.... This game is a mix of Genshin impact and honkai star rail I don t like it and I don t like the character designs it has a lot of phisiques especially the girl
I Love WuWa
how tf is this game free bro LIKE MAN.
this is the best game that I have playing after gencient impact
"the game has everything Parkour , action fighting echo which like Pokemon and best part is story telling this is not a game its a anime you watching and playing excellent game but please optimize the game it become laggy some time"
"Barely optimized for mobile. It's so laggy. Also, I still stand by what I said. The story and characters are mid. The story hasn't ever been interesting. Yeah. Rinascita, or whatever it's called, was not better. The female characters are still just fanservice with the same personality and traits copy pasted. The most fanservice there is for the male characters is a low-cut collar shirt. Also, Cantarella is just an unbearable character to even look at. It's not worth all the hype. Seriously."
it has more fan service than hoyo games still i love it
"best open world gacha game, keep up the good work kuro!"
"Love this game, period."
Awesome fight mechanism. Blown away by it. Very good. Much better than a game I previously played. Overall the game is great!
it's a great game but I was thinking can you guys make this game to be compatible for my phone it's TECNO SPARK GO
I'd probably rather play this game than genshin if it weren't so laggy on my device
"The game had rough start with technical issues in the early release patch but kudos to Kuro as the developer team for the eagerness to listen for players feedback and keep on working to improve the game to this day. If you like open world exploration and satisfying real time combat, this is the game for you. While PC is the best to experience the game, the graphic is still one of the best, if not the best for mobile game standard. Very recommended"
"I don't like it much as I like genshin impact such because it is not enjoying as it is choppy and has not optimised graphics, animations ,gameplay and story line and not a good game enough so please re create the game with best story line, gameplay , optimised graphics and animations ,combat ,all for all phones please we want some best perfect gacha open world games to explore and enjoy the high detailed beautiful graphics, story line etc.Please perfect it soon!"
The animation is so good and clear! And even the characters are pretty and handsome!
Fun at first but its not beginner and f2p friendly at all.. All your pulls gives you useless stuff and you die at the very first side quest boss
"Best open World, best combat mechanics, best exploration, in any of gacha games."
"customer support service is very useless. I lost all my progress from the last time I played. very worthless. truly a ""made in china"" moment lol."
wuwa no.1
Best Gacha game. Amazing combat mechanics. Peak lore. Best character design
love it.
Absolute Cinema
nice
best gacha game ever
easy 5star. awesome Devs great game good mechanics concern for the gamers hard to pull? Nahhh. its always been good.
Bagus soh game yang selalu improve tiap updatenya
"Best gacha game I've ever play so far. Patch 2.0 is just peak story writing, the devs hands down the most active devs ever in history of anime style game. Their confidence in their own story is shown in the willingness to put skip button. Basically saying, if our story is boring, you can skip it, and holy hell, they really cook a solid one that I haven't skip a single part in the major quest. My complain is the lack of good 4 stars characters, and surely, lack of male characters."
"Great combat, great story, Devs actually listen to consumers. Weapon summons give guaranteed 5 stars at 80 pulls."
"hell yeah, but give us more male chars bro"
Masterpiece
it's the best game ever
"I like the story line and the environment of the game, and also the graphics effects are so sharp and smooth. Well done, i see a lot of improvement since the first time i played this game"
"so far.. the game is great especially the new main quest, the only problem is the optimization. I have dimensity 8200 chipset and it's still struggling to run on balanced settings (medium graphics) I try to tweak some settings to make it look good and smooth at the same time and it's still has some fps drop. overall, I love the story, lore and combat of the game. keep it up especially in the optimization. keep cooking kuro üî•üî•"
"Needs optimization on battery. I know it uses Url engine or smt but battery cost too high on mobile phone. Good audio on android phone unlike in Ps5.. audio, voices, skill sounds loses every second and the fps drops, not consistent 60 fps. It doesn't lag on high end device but battery consumption must be optimized. All good performance here on android but PlayStation version is poorly managed.. Do something about it and fix it, Kuro. They said you listen to people ""requests"" so fix ps5 version"
Best game ever
okayy
"This game deserves a praise üëè one of the most enjoyable Open World Gatcha I ever played, the devs knows how to respect its players/fans. Every patch is a banger. I definitely recommend this game for those who are interested in a fast paced, challenging gameplay, and open world game. I hope they won't copy the bad business practices from other gatcha company **cough** Hoyover-.. ehe also the powercreep atm is not that inflated, easy exploration that don't consume your time, this game delivered"
god-tier gacha game
"Exceptional game, I've played genshin for 4 years so I can confidently say: genshin could never..."
undoubtedly the best anime style game.
Best mobile game ever
"compiling shaders everytime I open the game, very time consuming"
best game ever
"Day 1 player here. Since 1.0 there were a LOT OF BUGS within a game. I didn't get it at least on my phone, which kept me playing, and Kuro really kept dropping an epic bomb for every patch. Optimization, QoL Changes, Events, Story, Gameplay, all the possibilities that Kuro devs delivers always nailed me (Especially 2.0 and 2.2, which was A PEAK). Because of Cartethyia's story in 2.2, I was able to give this game a final review from me. Absolute 11/10. Keep this momentum, Kuro. You're GOAT now."
Pc quality slaps tho. Good storyline. Good luck kuro for the future. Even the mobile quality and performance has improved drastically from what it used to be back in 1.1 and 1.2üíÄ
best open world game ever
"Great game. Story, combat, exploration really great. Main Character not useless at all! Talk and battle he/she can do it all!"
More and more to become a good gacha games. keep it up kuro!!
"the plot got better, but the game is still not very optimised for mobile"
"Great game so far, i just love the transition of resonators when battling the enemies."
9/10 game imo and that's because the co op isn't fully fleshed out. if you overlook that it's an amazing rpg game that I'd recommend to anyone. they are generous with their rewards to the point you don't need to spend unless you want to. kuro has my full support rn and hope the future brings even more
Game terbaik sehat sehat selalu kurogames thank for everything
"Great Game and Dev!!! Keep up this humble and warm community, good job üëç"
more optimization
"This game is constantly improving, everything from the art style to mechanics to even characters keeps improving, but all characters are unique and hold up even months or a year later, love when the devs listen!"
"THE GAME IS VERY GOOD, I PLAYED IT SINCE VERSION 1.0, I LOVE THIS GAME, but kuro, please add more male characters in this gameü•∫ the male characters in wuwa don't even reach half of the female characters"
very good!
peak gacha game
I've been playing this game since its release... Updated review for version 2.2: Absolute banger! Kuro cooked! They keep on giving us quality content every patch. They continue to listen to their player base. The main story quest in this version is the best story and cinematic in any gacha game by far. Kudos to kuro! Please continue to cook!
"I feel like there is descrimination against certain characters like Lingyang where EVERY STANDARD unit got indirect buff like: Calcharo: Nightmare Thundering Mephis, Jianxin: Nightmare Beringal, Verina: Fallacy of No Return, Encore: Nightmare Inferno Rider and Cantarella's new weapon. The devs simply always avoid to indirectly buff Lingyang. Even with Nightmare Lampy Lumen Myrad, it is put in a set like Empyrean Anthem and Frosty Resolve, just to avoid buffing Lingyang. Utterly disappointed."
"Great game awesome! keeps improving, Keep it up kuro employees!"
"Keep cooking Kuro, can't wait for anniversary."
One of the most well crafted games in the genre with stunning visuals and a developer who really cares about the player experience. It feels like they really care about the player and make them feel appreciated. Plus the main character FEELS like a main character. God bless kuro üëç
17 gb! why not set download 17gb here. my cache server is only on Google. it will take me hours just to download this and enter in game. not everyone have high bandwidth wifi ffs.
great experience but quite laggy tho
I would just get stuck in the first boss battle no matter what server i play on like Whyy??? it doesn't work on mobile?!ugh forget it is not even ending when he is zero hp he just stands there and nothing happens I can't even leave the tacet field this is such a worst game what is the problem even after changing servers this is the worst seriously
very amazing
yes this game is awesome üòé
Actually improved
"Edit: changed Reviews for now. Back in the past when I reviewed the game I gave it a 3 star now im changing it to a 5 stars,I wanted to give 4,5 as theres always gonna be flaws,but I love the state of the game now,the feedback are being heard and they develop it on the game,LOF that makes the game more friendly than tidius here,dont get me wrong RNG for Echoes and Skill items is still weird(lol) but I love how feedbacks of players being heard I'm happy on the state of it and to get the passes."
genshin could never
THE GRAPHICS GO BBBRRRRRR!!!!
Combat and exploration is superb Story is great Now give it a try!
peak level gameplay
nice
getting better. very strange
pleaseee make it more playable in low devices hehe because it's still lagging for meTvT
"GOOD GAME. GOOD STORY. GOOD ANIMATION! . Also, need more revealing clothes of Mommy Characters"

gamenya keren yh
"It's really a good game but why in the log in takes so long just to get in, and every time I wanted to play there's this log in system keeps repeating every time I play"
thnks kurooo
"The story is great the character is amazing and all, the game is definitely improving in each update"
Damn good
Good game
Absolute Cinema
very good game! but my potato phone can't handle it lol
"‚Ä¢Going to regularly update this‚Ä¢ Incredible gacha game with gorgeous graphics and even better combat. Great music, very f2p/low spend-generous compared to Genshin, especially with their gacha banners. There is a distinct lack of polish, however: graphical bugs, stilted English VA, awkward translation. Overall I feel the pros FAR outweigh the cons here, but if the jank and lack of optimization is too much for you, check back in after a month. edit: nvm they cooked. 5/5"
tis gud ü§Øüòºüî•
ALMOST 5.0 RATING W GAME
everything is perfect.
"Game Dating Dgn grafik UE4, Battle apaanüòÇ"
This game is nice..guys should try this game
good
very nice game
I AM Having an Amazing Experience i would Like to play this game more in the future
Wuthering already at the peak of gacha gaming but it keeps improving. Can't wait to see how this game will improve. Hoping for more optimization for mobile and also for the official cloud gaming service. Wishing Kuro the best ‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è‚ù§Ô∏è
"Kuro games I love your game, but I just can't log in to my account and when I tried I always (this a brand new phone) crashes I don't know what I'm gonna do"
"I love the gameplay, storyline and how easy it is to navigate the functions."
it gets better
I haven't played a game like this before. after playing this game other games seems to be quite boring. this game Developers are the best they really listen to players request. this game is really improving with every update. thank you for this masterpiece.
cool
please keep improving
so good lah
"Hi dev, I hope u can fix the lag in SEA servers cause it's lag so bad.. I also hope it can be fix faster.. (edit: finally the lag have been reduced, thanks dev.. u deserved 5 star)"
Pluh!
"Amazing game. Wuthering waves is one of my favorite games ever. I would give this 5 stars, but for some reason whenever I try to log into the game, or try to play the game, it suddenly freezes the game and then suddenly the game closes and it takes forever to get back to playing the game again. Over all, The game is really fun. But if you are a mobile player like me then this issue is annoying since it always happens for me. Would recommend, but this issue is really annoying."
not perfect but the best by far
The game is good but the developers are not making the settings easier it's hard to adjust the graphics to look better üòï
"best gacha game ,,,, 10/10 ,,,"
almost perfect
Best Open world Gacha game Right now.
"I really love this game! The character designs are great, and the world is beautiful. The method of collecting echoes through open-world battles is awesome, and I personally enjoyed the story (I made it through the first main quest). The only thing is, I struggle so much to play on my device. I don't think it's something to criticize the game over, but it's honestly almost unplayable. Could you maybe have a cloud version? It made another game I've played work perfectly on my device~"
this game is getting so good. I really enjoy it üòå
"So cool, the graphics, skills, all of the animation are so beautiful, looking forward to other wonderful updates"
"I feel like the animations are stiff and unnatural. The cut scenes are fine. Audio quality feels bad for some reason, bad volume balancing at times as well. Good base game (but hard to mean it as a compliment when it clearly took ""inspirations""). Quality is improving with time so that's good. Quick swap gameplay won me over."
perfection fr
got cantarrlla am happy ty
good
absolute cinema!!!
"Never loved a game, so much. To Kuro, you guys blew me away. The stories, characters, and visuals are stunning. Music and cut scenes ... I'm just speechless. I'm still hoping for a ps4 release. Please do say if it's not possible for I'll try other platforms just for the graphical esthetics. Thank you for such a breathtaking game, and I will be looking forward to future content"
yay
Best played on pc. The game is not optimized for mobile.
game kikir ga dapat Cantarellaü§¨
it's nice but also no diversity.
absolute cenima
W game
so fun!!
really really good one
damn it why should we as to download the entire resource from the beginning after the each update
Absolute Cinemaüôå
ABSOLUTE CINEMA
Just 2 words. ABSOLUTE CINEMA ‚úãü§ö
"This is the best open-world gacha game I've played so far. The generosity of the Kuro developers and willingness to improve their game through surveys and reading critics are what attract me to this game. I have been playing for months, and I am truly satisfied with every patch. Where each patch is another cooking. Good job, Kuro. I hope you don't change like the other companies."
amazing game the combat is perfect
"Please wuwa developers, make some characters with the same charm genshin has. Design-wise and more colorful. I'm really tired of genshin. It ruined so many artifacts. Countless times. √ó Btw, controls like dash are too small on touch controls. Missed so many dash/evades thanks to it. on phone."
my idea on what would make it more fun and interesting if they do a collaboration with their old game pgr. bosses and characters in the game like my fioverite vonnegut and alpha can be guest characters if kuro do this then they will be cooking
Favorite gacha game thanks kuro
good
hahaha nice wish
flip you Kuro for making me wanna Play it again
give nice luck to me
"I love this game. I dropped my 3 years of unhealthy addiction with Genshin just 2 months after downloading this game. The developers are so kind, and you can feel the love they put into the game. The combat is so much fun, and the visuals are stunning. I truly have so much fun with this game, and I can't wait to see what they have to come. I highly recommend this game to others if you want to play a game worth your time."
"Wow just wow. Was looking for an open world anime like game that actually have anime like fight and this did not disappoint. The combat is chief kiss and the world is beautiful. Not overly time consuming too, whoever this company is u have my respect no joke."
Buggy and poor optimisation for a gacha game. If you enjoy a pay to win endgame then this game is for you!
goddamn it i love wuwa
"undoubtedly the best game on mobile and should have won game of the year, amazing story, character design and world building is top notch and the best part? it keeps getting better the more I play and the more updates they do. keep it up dev team, you guys are great!"
"I think the optimizations on the performance could be better... but,, it's still playable tho.... keep up the good work!!"
this game are improving I like the gameplay the graphics are smooth and the character design are good the story was amazing I hope this game will improve more.
best
"Really laggy...my device is fine. The characters are fire though üîù, it's really just the lag and the ping ..( always 80-100+ smh. ) maybe it requires a higher-end device lol üòÜ really not compatible with mobile."
okkk
"""Addictive & Immersive! Wuthering Waves is an incredible game that's got me hooked! The unique blend of exploration, strategy, and relaxation is absolute perfection. Stunning visuals, captivating soundtrack, and intuitive controls make for an unforgettable experience. I love discovering hidden secrets and upgrading my gear. A true masterpiece!"
great games
wonderful
this game is absolute cinema and i love the details also i hope the story gets more darkerüòçüòçüíÄüíÄ
I don't want a harem I want catching bodies
"Fantastic game in every sense imo, be it art, graphics, combat, exploration and now, story too. Also the latest update optimized the mobile performance a lot. Overall, a standout among a horde of gacha games."
amazing game. must play. good as genshin
it's Great
"very bad experience. when the game came out at first, i download it and played it for a month or so,had very good time playing it but now i came back to see how it was and guess what? account wiped out!,all my 5 stars were gone,literally starting from the beginning. message the support team in discord and i wish i could show you how they just closed my ticket without a reason or giving me any response to my account being wiped out. 0 out of 5."
needs more optimization for low end devices
"I change my rating and I'm rating here because I play only in PC, so this game really makes me emersed, the combat,the character design,the voice and especially the environment and mechanics. I love them all, the story is so beautiful and nice, I sometimes skip but because I'm busy, and I really enjoy that each class has mechanics, not some copy paste with different effects. 5/5 for me and I hope it always surprise me more."
"used to dislike this game and felt bored every time i played it and eventually i stop playing Wuwa in 1.2. but after trying it again in 2.1, i have to admit that wuwa has improved by a lot. wuwa is now one of my most played game. keep the good work wuwa."
"I love this game but i need an option to change my email or unlink google, fb etc T-T pls kuro!!!"
the game was fun... but please add more male charachter

"peak gaming, story and game play, amazing game that keep improving with amazing speed, the dev always listen to the player feed back, the quality and the performance of this game amaze me, WW maybe dont have the best start but it have the best improvement in gacha game history"
"Played since ver 1.1 My 3rd review: Not gonna lie, the game just keeps getting better and better. The developers never fail to listen to their players and just keeps improving the game, design, quality of life as every patch emerges. To compare to other gacha games i've played, I have never been this impressed about WuWa's character designs, combat systems and overall gameplay. Thank you Kuro for creating this amazing game not only for me to enjoy, but for the majority as well. Keep cooking!"
so I like this app BUT IT'S SO LAGGY AND MINE CRASHED LIKE 2 TIMES NOW
best game
ABSOLUTELY CINEMA üî•üî•
"Combat is peak, the world gets more beautiful and diverse by the patch. 100% weapon rate up guarantee is a cherry on top. From the developers of Punishing Gray Raven, I expect them to cook to make even crazier, flashy characters in future AND buff the old characters to keep up. And I can trust them to have a really good balance between casual fun events, and hardcore combat. 10/10 recomend."
the best game i ever play! but i wish they add more outfits to purchase & add HOME BUILDING mechanics that can build anywhere around the map and add more furniture like old/modern style
it is very good i like this game
Absolute cinema!!!!!!!!! PEAK!!!!!!
"If only I could give 9 stars instead. Every patches got better and better. Stories, scenes, characters, and musics are insane."
"I really liked wuwa, the combat is good and the world is beautiful, though the story can be improved,"
best mobile game
"2.2 overall is excellent. storyline, character build and charisma, cutscene, animation and etc all on TOP QUALITY"
"I love it, every update just keeps getting better"
Brings a smile to my face
"RELEASE LUMI. currently playing on PC rn cause it's more comfy and I'm experiencing how fun Lumi is to play so DEVS DEVS DEVS DEVS DEVS DEVS DEVS DEVS DEVS DEVS DEVS DEVS DEVS. PLEASE RELEASE LUMI. PLEAAAAAAAAAASE SHES SO FUN. HOW HAVE NOBODY COMMENTED ABT HOW FUN TO USE SHE IS ALREADY?????? IN MY HEART THE GAME IS 5 STARS BUT 4 STAR FOR NOW CAUSE I NEED LUMI, THANK YOU DEVS!!!!"

FINALLY lost my passion to play the game. please support low end devices also
"Thank you for just being a better company, developer, and game. I appreciate it."
this is better and amazing than garbage impact better cause at least they don't have that moon sister paimon the primordial one in it whew good thing the third defender is not in this wuwa is better
"I like this game so much. My favourite is the Rover being themselves and not merely just a self-insert character so, I appreciate if you keep this up dev. Thank you for creating this game üôáüôá"
"the devs never dissapoints every patch you will see improvements the rewards the exploration everything is perfect, this is what you call a best game devs are listening the the player's feedback f2p friendly with healthy community. continue the good work kuro games, solid supporter here."

best Action Gacha game ever
"Best character design, best graphics, best character voice over, best combat gameplay..... absolute cinema"
this game crashed in my device and it's lagging so bad and it has a lot of bugs that physically bugging my gameplay. The designs are OK but the experience was not it.
"play since open tha global release but had to stop cause it so lagging maybe my phone and im not mad just disappointed that i couldn't play anymore. i really love the story, character design and the combat just right:)"
goat üóøthan geshin
Just the optimization and the rates on the banner made me quit this game sorry not gonna come back anymore
why bug?
The weapon banner are absolutely the best.I don't have to worry about losing my 50/50.Now I have 2 characters that has signature weapon.Awesomeüëç
best of the best
"Review post 2.2. Game is amazing. Best gacha game on the market imo. Only con is the 1.0 story is pretty bad, and compared to 2.0-2.2 it's very very bad. my recommendation would be for 1.0 story rework since that is supposed to be the new player hook. The echo rng farm is also painful. Other than that, everything else is on a level of a paid jrpg experience."
I NEED scarüëÖüòã
Awesome sauce
"from generic story version 1.0 to the best story 2.2. this game grew a lot and become the best gacha open world both action and story because kuro always listen and can filter to get the best feedback. For me, the only feedback I have for Kuro regarding Wuthering Waves is how empty the world feels after completing the story. The world-building is still lacking, when I visit certain places, they feel empty, as if they have no story at all. I hope kuro continue delivers. for me Wuwa got 4.8/5"
"Gameplay: 10/10 Graphics: 10/10 Story: 8/10 Feedback: 8/10 Sound Designs: 9/10 I've been waiting this game since they reveal it and been playing it since launched although I'm playing Wuthering Waves on PC mostly due to much better control and powerful hardware that I have, but I already try this game on mobile once The game mechanic similar to Genshin Impact but more polished and combat-focused rather than relying element reaction"
aye better than genshin atleast
GOD TIER GAME Since the release
cooooooooooool
ON PC THIS GAME IS ACTUALLY AAA QUALITY
"still,fps drop is uncomfortable for me hopefully this problem will fix it soon in PC version"
good but ogr still better
they really just keep improving and improvingg!! i love so far the QoL they made during patch 2.0 onwards and the story is captivating so much!! i could play this game for hours and it really feels theyre taking care of their players and listen to their audience for feedback!! keep growing kuro games!!!
2.2 is just...phenomenal
love u kuro
No need to explain the Greatness!!!!
best game made by kuro
this game has the best graphics I have seen but I can't play it for more than a minute even though I have an android version of above 10.Please fix this.

Game crashes constantly. Literally unplayable. Terrible that this is live as is. I'm on a samsung S24 FE. Still crashes for weeks after every update.
Thank you for the Cantarella 1 pull after getting Camellya‚ù§

Please add unlink/change email feature. üôè
ti good for gaming but it's pay to win game aso
Wuthering Waves is a great game. But i only just started to play today and i'm already having a hard time. Right now i'm doing the main story quest and for some reason keeps kicking me out. I downloaded Wuthering Waves because i like it but now it's lagging and i really don't know what i have to do to continue playing....
"Well, you made me spend more money on than any other games I've played. Great update. Please keep going!"
buy too much good review
Too sexual
guaranteed weapon banner
"Absolutely phenomenal. Legit open world, action RPG, you can play on mobile or PS5 seamlessly. Don't know why I waited so long to give it a shot, but glad I did."
"i love everything since the 2.0 came out, although a bit disappointed zani didn't come early but everything is very well detailed, i love it!"
"horrible on my phone, but on my PS5 it's amazing. keep up the good work kuro üôèüèª"
The story is probably the best in all gacha
"Has one of the best stories among gacha games, amazing and attractive character design. Plus, the devs listen to it's fanbase unlike..."
"honestly, i can not think of any other free game with as much dedication as this one. Combat, animations, character and npc design, world building, lore, new mechanics, cinematics, music. You can actually notice all of this getting better every update that one just has to recognize their passion. If your are somewhat interested in the game, go ahead and play it, wether you dwell in the combat or simply the story, it will make you feel more and more immersed as you play that you wont regret it."
I hope for the developers to fix the unstable connections and hoping that we can switch to our RESPECTIVE SERVERS üòÖ
keeps crashing.
cool game
This is my new update review on 2.2.Really beautiful and absolute cinema.I don't know how to show my feeling and emotion.In every version the game is improve to next level.Thanks kuro and Developer team.The one and only legendary game wuthering waves.
keep it up!
Y'all don't deserve genshin and hsr players review bombing the game. Wuthering Waves is so good they're full mode defending a really bad game(only good at start)
Its peak
nice game but can you add arabic language plzz a playing this for monthsü´°ü´°
No problems
good game
"I just completed canterella companion quest,is she married and have children because she mentioned ""our children will no longer suffer more like that"" ,at that point I truly cried üò≠.why kuro did that"
Absolute Cinema
best 2.2 patch
It's clear you won't stop with rover harem reducing all female characters to just another fanservice. Atleast don't sexualize youthful and mentally unstable and the easily manipulated trope in sexualized clothes as camellya. Make as many waifus but don't put characters like camellya and katixia in the story or give us an option to avoid such things. Pheobe for example is fine because she's youthful but clothed. Carlotta is fine too because she seems well put together and not too revealing
"Its breathtaking, engaging, and overall, just a fantastic game. However, I am only a mobile player üò© and my storage? It's choking due to the lack of space. Perhaps, if I had a separate device, I would've downloaded on there, but I don't. I am 7 gb short... and I am unable to go any further. I fought through blood, sweat, and tears to play this game (aka, to make room for it), and it was worth it. But now, I must say goodbye üò¢ good bye wuwa, goodbye husbandos, goodbye newly required Brant. üò≠üíî"
I love this game
"I love it it's one of my favorite games of all time the Combat, Characterdesign and a lot more I love it, but i was forced to uninstall because the phone couldn't handle it but im still playing on pc"
(3rd review) absolutely love the game but I have a request I max out the graphics but for some reason the resolution seems a bit off I don't know if it your way to optimized but if it is can you give us a settings that we can change the resolution?
"(v2.2) the game actually really good but the experience i feel on my phone was really bad, i can't even move because very lag."
"I enjoyed the game,story,character design,graphic and many more. I like the little details given in the by the team and i love this game so much and user friendly."
amazing
"Great game, I love the fighting and exploration mechanics, they are also very generous about the game currency(asterites), the characters are cool, cute and hot too. Overall, a fun and engaging game."
baik modal kena tungu lama
"It's pretty good, it's a lot like genshin but I like it, its not as colorful and doesn't hurt your eyes as much, it's a bit buggy, in combat or such things that raise your frames the game will close and go to your homescreen which is a tad annoying but otherwise I see no issues and enjoy the game quite a bit"
worst game ever
"it was a nice game overall from the gameplay to the quality of life system that help the player. the only concern that i have as a player is way to earn more funding for the gacha to get the new characters as i don't spend money at all. aside from the story, event, map exploration. which is plenty bountiful if i say. but after the story/event/map is cleared i don't see a way for casual player which maybe or not play just for a few minutes or hour to get more of the fund for gacha."
Thanks for always listening to us üôè The optimisation I was hoping for are being added and i really appreciate it 5-star for being such a great listener
best
sick
One thing i hate about this game is their optimization because not all phones can handle these types of game unlike genshin there have their smooth game optimization even with a phone that has a weal processor such as mediatek helio g88 below. I hope these will be optimized more
i love
The ga. The gameplay was good and the storyline was amazing
This is the best game i even play before it's so worth it to install i love it so much!!!
peak
"I'll rephrase everything I've said the game is pretty good first of all a skip button that works to everything that exist ingame a+. The world building, the scenery is just astounding, it is absolutely lively and colorful even in android devices but it's much better in PC. The difficulty of some content are also great but I despise time gated combat it's BS and predatory, but despite all that the characters appearance are damn so detailed and beautiful I mean look at Jinhsi she's the best!!! 500"
"In terms of story, extremely weak opening during 1.0 but rapidly picks up til 1.4. Now 2.0 onwards sets a high precedent among 3D open world action RPG gachas. Amazing storytelling. Fantastic combat. Outstanding open world traversal. Reasonable gacha elements. However, game needs improvements on the gearing system and co-op. Keep cooking Kuro. The final rating will be on the game's 1st anniversary."

To be honest the game is really good I enjoyed over a month but in the same time I also experience lag and heat on my device. Optimization is my request right now.
"The best game in my opinion, and definitely a breath of fresh air after Genshin. I love the gameplay, and I love the mechanics. The characters might need a bit more work, but the diverse animations and the lore really made up for it. I don't mind female playable characters, but I do wish there's more male characters. Kuro Games seem like they have the potential to make good-looking male characters than Genshin, I hope we have more characters like Brant, Aalto, Xiangli Yao, etc. Overall, amazing!"
I'm playing this on poco f6. But still lags sometimes in medium graphics settings. still no improvement. optimize it for sd 8s gen 3
