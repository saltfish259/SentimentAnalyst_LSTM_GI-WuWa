"A VERY GREEDY GAME, first of all they said they won't make another end game and then 4 years later they did ONLY TO SPLIT THE REWARD FROM 1ST ENDGAME INTO HALF AND ADD ANOTHER HALF TO 2ND ENDGAME, which mean more work for same reward. And when there's aniversary they deduct the primos u can aquired from before patch and post patch, so it used to be 80 pulls perpatch, and they deduct it to 60 and add 100 in anniversary, daiwei cry about genshin change is crocodile tear, NOTHING HAS CHANGE",a very greedy game first of all they said they wont make another end game and then 4 years later they did only to split the reward from 1st endgame into half and add another half to 2nd endgame which mean more work for same reward and when theres aniversary they deduct the primos u can aquired from before patch and post patch so it used to be 80 pulls perpatch and they deduct it to 60 and add 100 in anniversary daiwei cry about genshin change is crocodile tear nothing has change,1

This game should guarantee us our desired specific 4star characters after few pulls. As for now there is about 16% of getting our desired single 4 star character from the limited character banner and it's 32% if we lost our 50/50. But there is no guarantee of getting the 4 star character that we want. This is so wrong. Stupid money hungry company.,this game should guarantee us our desired specific 4star characters after few pulls as for now there is about 16 of getting our desired single 4 star character from the limited character banner and its 32 if we lost our 5050 but there is no guarantee of getting the 4 star character that we want this is so wrong stupid money hungry company,0

"To be honest, I enjoyed the game at first, but there are a number of issues I have with it. Poor storytelling, most characters feel rather one-note personality-wise, minimal rewards, awful gacha, game mechanics are very poorly explained, overreliance on text for almost everything, missing character voices, some areas being laggy AF, overheating issues, minimal QoL changes since day 1, and the awfully toxic and braindead community. The Inazuma Archon Quests were so bad it made me drop the game.",to be honest i enjoyed the game at first but there are a number of issues i have with it poor storytelling most characters feel rather onenote personalitywise minimal rewards awful gacha game mechanics are very poorly explained overreliance on text for almost everything missing character voices some areas being laggy af overheating issues minimal qol changes since day 1 and the awfully toxic and braindead community the inazuma archon quests were so bad it made me drop the game,0

"I started playing Genshin around the time it was originally released. It had beautiful landscapes and a meaningful storyline.

In order to get to the good parts of the story you have to get through a LOT of random npcs who aren't even helping the main narrative. The game barely has any combat after you reach endgame. You'll be stuck grinding the same stuff over and over. This hasn't changed in 3 years. The game barely rewards players in comparison to other gacha games.

"The magic is gone. Once upon a time, booting up Genshin would cue responses of ""wow, that's a mobile game?"" But beautiful character design and pretty graphics can't distract you from the glaring faults in the game forever. Fans praise the story, but I'm convinced that they're actually praising the lore. The storytelling itself is a slow, bloated, tedious mess worse than any MMORPG ever was.

"It's a good game if you enjoy exploring and Zelda-like puzzles. Co-op is a poorly designed gimmick. The dialogue is boring due to MC being a puppet, and Paimon assumes the player has zero awareness of the plot. Therefore, the writing is largely shallow and boring. Excellent combat design that is muddied by a powercreep gacha monetization model. The characters are gorgeous, but expect to spend hundreds of USD (or hundreds of hours) to get your faves.

Really interesting lore and insanely fun gameplay but... the QoL features are insanely bad... like the resin for example. how is there not a resin reserve feature? Cause only 5 condensed resin is not sufficient enough and the gatcha mechanic is very... VERY unclear. this game from a gameplay standpoint is really good but it has a lot of scummy moves in the internal features which is a huge shame... do better hoyo your fans deserve better.,really interesting lore and insanely fun gameplay but the qol features are insanely bad like the resin for example how is there not a resin reserve feature cause only 5 condensed resin is not sufficient enough and the gatcha mechanic is very very unclear this game from a gameplay standpoint is really good but it has a lot of scummy moves in the internal features which is a huge shame do better hoyo your fans deserve better,1

"Amazing for a free open world game. In my opinion, it hasnt grown in the ways it needs to. The storyline is great.

"At first, amazing. Ive been playing this game for two or more years now and have thoroughly enjoyed it. However... after Natlan released, the game just seemed to fall off. The game has become a waifu simulator and only 2 male characters have been released since; One is a 4 star and one is basically irrelevant to the plotline. The storyline was okay but I have to say it definitely wasn't nearly as good as the previous nations. Overall, wouldn't recommend.",at first amazing ive been playing this game for two or more years now and have thoroughly enjoyed it however after natlan released the game just seemed to fall off the game has become a waifu simulator and only 2 male characters have been released since one is a 4 star and one is basically irrelevant to the plotline the storyline was okay but i have to say it definitely wasnt nearly as good as the previous nations overall wouldnt recommend,1

"This is the first time I'm leaving a bad review for a game. That's how much it sucks. It starts off great but eventually it burns you out with all the grind, making it feel like work rather than fun. Even the dialogues are unnecessarily long, boring and can't be skipped. Everything is RNG/time gated. The new area update brought with it new server issues on top of everything else.
